# SCHOOLCORD

Multi-tenant school management SaaS.

> **On the name.** This was built under two earlier names — "Dependable" (an
> internal codename) and "Fulfilled Lite" (a working title). Both are gone from
> everything a user or an admin sees. The product is **SCHOOLCORD**, and the
> name now lives in exactly one file: `apps/core/branding.py`. A handful of
> internal identifiers still carry the codename — the Postgres database name,
> a contextvar, and `DependableUserManager`, which is serialised into
> `accounts/0001_initial.py` — and are left alone deliberately: nobody sees
> them, and rewriting an applied migration to rename a manager class buys
> nothing. See [Branding and identity](#branding-and-identity).

- **Step 1 — foundation:** tenancy, a custom user model, the query-scoping
  pattern, the design-system shell, and the admin.
- **Step 2 — academic setup:** classes and subjects per branch, with management
  screens.
- **Step 3 — fee structures:** terms, and what each class owes per term.
- **Step 4 — student records:** the roster, entered by hand or imported from a
  spreadsheet, with each student's fee position derived from their class.
- **Step 5 — the public side:** landing page, signup, login with a per-role
  landing, password reset, and the onboarding checklist that ties the four
  setup steps together.
- **Step 6 — parent messaging:** SMS/WhatsApp to parents, each school sending
  under its own registered Sender ID.
- **Step 7 — payments:** money recorded against a student, with every balance
  derived from confirmed payments.

## Running it

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate            # macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

copy .env.example .env           # macOS/Linux: cp .env.example .env

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

### Local demo data

> **Local only.** Everything in this section creates invented schools, students,
> fees and payments, and `bootstrap_tenant` creates a **superuser**. Run it
> against your own SQLite database, never a shared or production one. Real
> accounts are made with the commands in
> [Creating real accounts](#creating-real-accounts).

```bash
python manage.py bootstrap_tenant --password "<a local password>"   # Demo School + one user per role
python manage.py seed_academics --create-school       # a demo "Fulfilled Academy" / Main Campus
python manage.py seed_fees                            # First Term 2025/2026 pricing
python manage.py seed_students                        # 60 invented students across 9 classes
```

`bootstrap_tenant` creates a school, a branch, and four accounts, all with the
password you pass as `--password` (always pass one):

| Username                  | Role                      | Sees                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `platform.owner`          | Platform Owner            | every school               |
| `demo-school.owner`       | School Owner              | one school, all branches   |
| `demo-school.principal`   | Principal / Branch Admin  | one branch                 |
| `demo-school.bursar`      | Bursar                    | one branch                 |

Run it again with `--name "Rival College"` to create a second tenant and watch
the isolation hold.

### CSS

The compiled stylesheet is committed, so the project runs without Node. To
change the design tokens, edit `assets/app.css` and rebuild:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:css     # or: npm run watch:css
```

### Database

Postgres is the target; SQLite is the local fallback.

- **Neither `DATABASE_URL` nor `DB_NAME` set** → SQLite.
- **Postgres configured but unreachable** → SQLite, with a warning on stderr.
- **`DB_ENGINE=postgres`** → Postgres required, no fallback (what `config.settings.prod` uses).
- **`DB_ENGINE=sqlite`** → SQLite always.

Connection poolers (Supabase, PgBouncer) are detected by host or port `6543` and
get `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS = True`, because transaction-mode pooling hands
each statement a different backend and breaks Django's server-side cursors.
Override the detection with `DB_POOLED=1` / `DB_POOLED=0`.

Settings live in `config/settings/`: `base.py`, then `dev.py` (the default) and
`prod.py`. `manage.py` defaults to `config.settings.dev`; `wsgi.py`/`asgi.py`
default to `config.settings.prod`.

## Tests

```bash
python manage.py test apps
```

656 tests, covering the parts that must never regress: what each role can see,
what each role may change, that a fee total always equals its live line items,
that a student's expected fee is always read from their class rather than stored
on them, that each senior arm carries exactly the subjects the school named,
that a spreadsheet import reports every bad row, imports the good ones, and
writes all-or-nothing, and that a signup builds exactly one school, branch and
owner while each role lands on its own dashboard.

Admissions adds 106 of its own: that a public enquiry writes to the school in
its URL and refuses another school's branch or class, that an enquiry becomes an
application without a single field being re-asked, that KG skips the entrance
exam while Primary and Senior sit it, that enrolment produces a Student in the
right class and branch and keeps the link back, that admission fees and termly
fees never touch, that a lapsed enquiry is closed rather than deleted, and that
one school cannot see another's applicants.

Modules add 67: that fees and student records cannot be switched off and that
messaging and admissions are off until somebody says otherwise, that the platform
owner can toggle and that a school owner cannot — not even for their own school,
and not by POSTing to the endpoint directly — that every URL a switched-off module
owns answers 403 with a page rather than a 500, including one that does not exist
yet, that the school's public enquiry page 404s while admissions is off and opens
again when it is on, that switching a module off deletes no rows and switching it
back on restores the screens, that toggling school A never moves school B, and that
Fulfilled Academy's recorded state is the one the client asked for.

Reports adds 46: that one school's report never contains another's campus, class
or child — including when the other school's id is typed into the query string
— that expected, collected and outstanding are the same numbers the dashboards
show, that confirming or voiding a payment moves every figure at once, that an
overdue term turns unpaid balances overdue, that the export is a PDF and arrives as
a download, that every amount on it carries both spellings and no substitute font
ever reaches the file, and that the tables which came off the dashboards are gone
from them and present on the report.

Messaging adds a class of its own for the gateway: that a batch goes out under
the school's own Sender ID on Termii's `dnd` route, that a success and a refusal
map onto the right `MessageRecipient` rows, that nothing but an explicitly
promotional message reaches the `generic` route -- a blank, a typo or a purpose
nobody thought about all fall to `dnd` -- and that two schools sending in the
same run never borrow each other's name. Termii is exercised against a recorded
request rather than the network, so the assertions are about what the gateway
would actually receive. The negative-path tests deliberately trigger
403s and 404s, so Django logs tracebacks during a passing run.

---

## How the tenancy works

Isolation is enforced in the model layer, not per view.

1. `TenantMiddleware` reads `request.user` and publishes a `TenantContext`
   (school, branch, role) into a `contextvars` variable for the request.
2. Tenant-scoped managers read that context in `get_queryset()` and filter
   before any view code runs.

So a view writes `Student.objects.all()` and gets only its own tenant's rows.
There is nothing to remember and nothing to forget.

### Adding a tenant-scoped model

Subclass `TenantScopedModel` and you're done:

```python
from apps.core.models import TenantScopedModel

class Payment(TenantScopedModel):     # brings school + branch FKs and indexes
    reference = models.CharField(max_length=64)
```

Use `BranchScopedModel` instead when the record must live at one campus, as
`Class`, `Subject` and `Student` do. It makes `branch` required and derives
`school` from it, so a platform owner — who has no school of their own — can
still create rows.

You get:

- `school` and `branch` foreign keys (`branch` nullable — some records belong to
  the school as a whole).
- `Payment.objects` — filtered by the active tenant automatically.
- `Payment.all_objects` — never filtered, for jobs and cross-tenant reporting.
- `save()` stamps `school`/`branch` from the active context when left blank.
- `created_at` / `updated_at`.

### Roles and what they see

| Role                         | Scope    | Rows visible                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `platform_owner`             | platform | everything                                     |
| `school_owner`               | school   | all branches of their school                   |
| `principal` (branch admin)   | branch   | their branch + school-wide rows (`branch=NULL`) |
| `bursar`                     | branch   | their branch + school-wide rows                |

Defined once in `apps/core/roles.py`. Two rules worth knowing:

- **No context = no filtering.** Outside the request cycle (shell, migrations,
  management commands) queries are unfiltered — otherwise `migrate` could not
  see its own rows. Background jobs that should act as a tenant must say so:
  `with scope_to(school_id=..., branch_id=..., role=...):`.
- **Misconfiguration fails closed.** An unknown role, or a branch-scoped role
  with no branch assigned, sees nothing rather than defaulting to wider access.

Escape hatches, both deliberately visible in review:

```python
from apps.core.tenancy import unscoped, scope_to

with unscoped():                  # cross-tenant reporting, support tooling
    Student.objects.count()

with scope_to(school_id=7, branch_id=3, role=Role.BURSAR):
    ...                           # background job acting as a tenant
```

### Capabilities: what a role may *do*

> Capabilities are the ceiling, and a school's [modules](#modules-what-each-school-has)
> take some of it back: `capabilities_for(role)` is the pure role table, and
> `capabilities_of(user)` is that table minus anything belonging to a module the
> account's school does not have.


Scoping answers "which rows?". Capabilities (`apps/core/permissions.py`) answer
"which actions?" — so a bursar can have full visibility of the academic setup
while still being unable to change it.

| Capability         | Platform owner | School owner | Principal | Bursar |
| ------------------ | :------------: | :----------: | :-------: | :----: |
| `view_academics`   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `manage_academics` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `view_fees`        | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `manage_fees`      | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `view_students`    | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `manage_students`  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |

A bursar collects against the fee structure but does not decide it, and finds
students in order to take money from them rather than to enrol or remove them —
so they read all three layers and change none. The money-*movement* capabilities
arrive with the payments layer.

Grants live in one table, `ROLE_CAPABILITIES`, never in an ad-hoc check inside a
view. Enforce with the mixin, and hide the controls to match:

```python
class ClassCreateView(CapabilityRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    capability = Capability.MANAGE_ACADEMICS
```

```html
{% if "manage_academics" in capabilities %} ... {% endif %}
```

The mixin raises 403 for a signed-in account that lacks the capability (rendered
by `templates/403.html`) and redirects anyone signed out to the login page.
Hiding a button is presentation; the mixin is the enforcement, and it blocks POST
as well as GET.

### Permission role vs. job title

Two separate fields on `User`, on purpose:

- **`role`** — the permission role. Controls what the account can see. One of the
  four above.
- **`job_title`** — free text, e.g. "Head of Mathematics". Descriptive only,
  grants nothing.

Promoting someone's job title is an HR change, not an access change.

### Why `User.objects` is not scoped

Authentication backends and `createsuperuser` resolve users through the default
manager, before any tenant context exists — scoping it would break login. Use
`User.scoped` for tenant-facing staff listings; the admin is narrowed separately
by `TenantScopedAdminMixin`.

## Academic setup

Step 2 of onboarding, at `/academics/`. Both models are `BranchScopedModel`, so
every list and lookup is tenant-filtered without a line of filtering in any view.

**`Class`** — a teaching group. `name` holds the year without its arm ("SSS 2")
and `stream` holds the arm ("Science", "A"); `display_name` joins them the way
staff say it, appending a one-letter arm ("JSS 1A") and spacing a word one
("SSS 2 Science"). Splitting them is what lets every arm of a year sort together
and lets a subject attach to one arm but not the other.

Ordering is by `level` then `year_in_level`, so classes always list in admission
order — Pre-KG first, SSS 3 last. `Level` values are spaced (10/20/30/40) to
leave room for a band in between later without a data migration.

**`Subject`** — attached to classes many-to-many, because one subject genuinely
spans several. Mathematics is *one* row linked to Primary 1 through both arms of
SSS 3, not fifteen near-duplicates.

Class names are unique per branch, not per school, so every campus can run its
own "JSS 1".

### Bulk entry: nineteen classes, one submission

A school sets up around nineteen classes, and used to do it nineteen times:
open the form, fill five fields, save, land back on the list, press New again.
The screens at `/academics/classes/add-many/`,
`/academics/subjects/add-many/` and `/staff/invite-many/` are the same records
entered as a table.

Three things remove the round trips:

- **The campus is asked once**, at the top, instead of on every row.
- **Presets fill a whole band** from one press. The rungs come from
  `apps/academics/curriculum.py` — the same list `seed_academics` uses — so the
  button and the seed can never describe different ladders. "The whole ladder"
  is exactly the nineteen classes above.
- **Level and year are read off the name.** `infer_level("JSS 2")` is the junior
  band, `infer_year` is 2; "Basic 8" is junior secondary, "Basic 3" primary.
  These are *defaults offered to a visible form field*, never silent writes — a
  wrong guess costs one correction, and a name that cannot be read asks rather
  than guessing.

Nothing about what gets saved changes: these are ordinary ModelForms over the
same models with the same constraints. Each batch is one transaction, because
nineteen classes half-created with no indication of which nine is a worse state
to hand back than nothing at all.

`/academics/classes/edit-all/` is the other half — every class editable where it
sits, for renaming and deactivating without one page load each. Edit-only on
purpose: no blank rows at the bottom, because a table whose last three rows
behave differently from the rest is one people stop trusting.

The client-side half is one implementation shared by all four screens, plus the
fee line items: `data-repeat` in `js/ui.js`. A container declares
`data-repeat-prefix`, its rows carry `data-repeat-row`, and a `<template>`
supplies a blank one. Enter moves down the table instead of submitting it.
Without the script the server still renders its `extra` rows and the form still
posts — you simply get the rows you were given.

Single-record forms that people fill several of in a row (a class, a subject, a
term, one staff account) carry **Save and add another**, which returns to a
blank form instead of the list. The record written is identical either way.

### Seeding

`seed_academics` builds the ladder and subject list from
`apps/academics/curriculum.py` — one module, edit it and re-run:

```bash
python manage.py seed_academics --create-school
python manage.py seed_academics --replace-subjects   # after editing curriculum.py
```

It is idempotent, matching on (branch, name). For Fulfilled Academy that is 19
classes (13 single-arm plus three senior years × Arts/Science) and 34 subjects.

Thirty-four, not sixty-odd, because a subject taught at several levels is one
row: Religion Studies spans 13 classes, Mathematics spans 15. Where the name
differs by level it stays a separate subject — "Social Studies" (primary) and
"Social & Citizenship Studies" (secondary), "History" and "Nigeria History",
"Home Economics" (primary/junior) and "Home Management" (SSS Arts).

| Level | Subjects per class |
| ----- | -----------------: |
| Nursery | 8 |
| Primary | 10 |
| Junior Secondary | 10 |
| Senior Secondary | 11 per arm |

### The senior arms teach different subjects

Nursery through junior secondary is one list per band. Senior secondary is not:
SSS Science and SSS Arts carry **eleven subjects each, and only five of them
overlap**.

| | Subjects |
| --- | --- |
| Shared core | Mathematics, English Studies, Economics, Marketing, Civic Education |
| Science only | Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Agriculture, Geography, Livestock |
| Arts only | Commerce, Accounting, Government, Literature in English, Christian Religious Knowledge, Home Management |

Arm-specific subjects narrow their placement — `at(SENIOR, "Science")` — while
the shared five stay **one row each** at `at(SENIOR)` with no arm named, which
puts them on both. Duplicating them per arm would mean renaming a subject twice
and would make "how many subjects does SSS 2 Science take?" a question about our
data model rather than about the school.

The consequence worth knowing: several subjects that run through junior
secondary stop at JSS 3, because neither senior list includes them — Digital
Literacy, Nigeria History, Social & Citizenship Studies, Basic Science
Technology & PHE, Cultural and Creative Art, Religion Studies and Home
Economics. The senior arms pick their own equivalents up by name where the
school teaches one, which is why Christian Religious Knowledge and Home
Management are separate rows rather than senior placements of the junior
subjects.

## Fee structures

Step 3, at `/fees/`. Three models, all branch-owned:

```
Term  --<  FeeStructure  --<  FeeComponent
```

**`Term`** — one term of an academic year at a branch. Exactly one can be
current per branch, enforced by a partial unique index *and* by `save()`
standing the previous one down, so a stray script cannot leave two.

**`FeeStructure`** — the fee set for one class in one term, unique on
(class, term).

**`FeeComponent`** — a line item: name and amount, ordered by `position`.

### The total is never stored

`FeeStructure.total` is a property that sums the live components. There is no
total column, and a test asserts there never is one. A stored total is a second
source of truth that drifts the moment someone edits a line item, and
reconciling a payment against a stale figure costs a school real money.

The editor's live sum is display-only — the browser never posts a total, so a
JavaScript bug can degrade the typing experience but cannot change what a class
owes. The form and its line-item formset are validated together inside one
transaction, so a bad line can't leave a structure behind with no components.

### Screens

The list is grouped by level with per-level subtotals, defaults to the current
term, and ends with a "not yet priced" section — the question a school owner
actually has during onboarding. Terms themselves are managed in the Django
admin; say the word if they should get first-class screens too.

### Seeding

```bash
python manage.py seed_fees            # needs seed_academics to have run
python manage.py seed_fees --replace  # drop structures the pricing file dropped
```

`apps/fees/pricing.py` is the single source, the same way `curriculum.py` is for
academics. Fulfilled Academy's First Term 2025/2026 comes to 19 structures, 61
line items, ₦1,796,000 across the term.

Two things the pricing file handles deliberately:

- **One structure per class, never shared.** Primary 2–6 charge the same today,
  so they are written as one spec listing five class names — but the seeder
  creates five independent structures with their own components. Repricing
  Primary 3 leaves Primary 2 alone, and a test proves it.
- **`client_total` is a cross-check, never stored.** Where the school's written
  total disagrees with the line items, the seeder charges the line items and
  prints a warning. Primary 1 currently trips this: the line items sum to
  ₦102,000 against a written total of ₦104,000. The components are seeded as
  supplied and **no balancing line has been invented** — the ₦2,000 gap is a
  real question about the source data, and burying it in a fake component would
  make it unanswerable later.

## Student records

Step 4, at `/students/`. One model, `BranchScopedModel` like the rest, so a
principal's roster is their own campus without a line of filtering in any view.

**`Student`** — admission number, names, sex, dates of birth and admission,
status, and the parent/guardian contact the school actually calls about fees.

### Admission numbers are unique per branch, not globally

Two campuses of the same school both number their intake from 001, and neither
should have to renumber because the other got there first. The constraint is
`UniqueConstraint(Upper("admission_number"), "branch")` — case-insensitive, so
`FA/2025/001` and `fa/2025/001` collide, but the school's own casing is stored
as typed rather than rewritten. The form catches the clash first and reports it
on the field; the constraint is what makes it true regardless of how the row
arrives, which is what the Excel import leans on.

### The fee position is derived, never stored

A student's expected fee is the total of their class's `FeeStructure` for the
term their branch is currently in. It is computed in `apps/students/fees.py`,
and there is no fee column on `Student` — a test asserts there never is one.
Copying the figure onto the student would go stale the first time a class is
repriced and would then have to be corrected for every child in it by hand.

The list screen would make that derivation expensive if done per row, so
`fees.load(students)` fetches the current terms and the class totals in two
queries and answers for the whole page in memory. A test asserts a page of
twelve students costs the same as a page of two.

Payments do not exist yet, so `paid` is zero and every priced student reads as
**Unpaid** with the full term fee outstanding. That is honest rather than
decorative, and it is the seam the payments layer plugs into: fill
`FeeSchedule.payments` and the pills, balances and the "Payment history" card
on the detail page start telling the real story without those screens changing.
A student in a class with no structure for the term reads **No fees set**,
which is a setup gap the school needs to see — not a zero balance to be
reassured by.

### Screens

- **List** — searchable by name or admission number (whole or fragment, because
  staff quote either "FA/2025/014" or just "014"), filterable by class and
  status, 25 to a page. Defaults to active students; a roster that has run for
  years is mostly former ones.
- **Detail** — identity, class, guardian, and the fee position broken down to
  the line items behind it, with the payment-history slot laid out and labelled.
- **Add / edit** — manual entry. Branch is not a field: the class carries it, and
  asking for both invites the two to disagree. Removing a student offers
  "mark withdrawn" first, because deleting throws away the record that a payment
  will later need to hang off.
- **Import** — the bulk path for a school arriving with a roster already in a
  spreadsheet. Template, per-row validation report, then the write. See below.

Parent phone numbers are validated as Nigerian mobiles and stored in one
canonical form (`08034129876`), whichever of `0803 412 4567`, `+234 803 …` or
`234 …` was typed; the screens group them for reading and link them for calling.

### Excel import

At `/students/import/`, owner- and principal-level only (`MANAGE_STUDENTS`, so a
bursar gets a 403). Three screens, because the middle one is the product:

1. **Download** — `apps/students/workbook.py` builds an `.xlsx` from the column
   spec in `importer.py`: a header row, a guidance row showing the format of
   every field, drop-downs for Sex and Status, and a second sheet listing *that
   branch's* classes with the Class column validated against it. A school owner
   is offered one template per campus, because the class list differs.
2. **Upload and check** — every row is parsed and judged before anything is
   written. Nothing at all is saved by this step.
3. **Confirm** — the valid rows are written in one transaction.

**A bad row is not a bad file.** All-or-nothing sends the user back to fix one
cell at a time, so failure is per row: the report names the spreadsheet's own
row number, the column, and the reason — *"Row 14 — Admission Number
'FA/2025/001' already belongs to Chinaza Okonkwo; Class 'JS1' is not a class at
North"* — and the rows that passed can still be imported while the rest are
corrected. A row reports *all* of its problems at once, including the ones the
model finds, so the trip back to the spreadsheet happens once.

What is validated: the required fields (admission number, first and last name,
class, parent name and phone); the admission number against the branch's
existing roster *and* against the other rows of the same file, case-insensitively
like the constraint; the class against the branch's active classes, with
separate messages for unknown, inactive and ambiguous (`JSS 3` where the branch
runs `JSS 3A` and `JSS 3B`); sex, status and dates by parsing; and then the
model's own `full_clean` for phone format, email, lengths and the
born-after-admission rule, which are not restated here.

The realistic mess is handled rather than reported: columns are matched **by
heading, never by position**, with aliases (`Adm No`, `Surname`, `DOB`,
`Guardian`, `Phone`), so a school's own sheet imports; a title row above the
headings is found; whitespace is trimmed; blank rows anywhere are skipped;
columns we have no field for are ignored and listed; and a phone column Excel
turned numeric (`8031122334`) gets its leading zero back. A file that is not a
workbook, is not the template, or has no rows under its headings produces a
sentence on the form, never a 500.

Two things worth knowing about the shape of it:

- **`importer.py` never touches openpyxl; `workbook.py` never validates.** The
  reader hands over plain strings — dates as ISO — so validation is testable
  without building a workbook, and so the parsed rows survive the session.
- **The rows wait in the session, not a table.** An abandoned import leaves
  nothing to clean up. Validation then runs *twice*: once to draw the report,
  and again on confirm, because the roster can move while the report is on
  screen. A test covers exactly that race, and another asserts that a failure on
  the third student of a batch leaves the first two unwritten.

### Seeding

```bash
python manage.py seed_students            # needs seed_academics; seed_fees for fee positions
python manage.py seed_students --replace  # drop students the roster file dropped
```

`apps/students/roster.py` is the single source. Fulfilled Academy's pilot roster
is 60 students across 9 classes, ₦5,802,000 expected for First Term 2025/2026.

The data is deliberate rather than filler, because a roster of "Student One /
Student Two" hides the problems these screens exist to surface: admission
numbers carry their year of admission (so the same `001` recurs each year and
across branches), dates of birth match the class, two Okonkwo siblings sit in
Primary 1 and KG 2 sharing one guardian, and one student is withdrawn and one
inactive so the status filter has something real to filter.

## Parent messaging

At `/messaging/`. Entirely staff-side and outbound: **parents never sign in.**
The platform's whole relationship with a parent is an SMS or WhatsApp message
going out, and a row recording what became of it.

### The provider interface comes first

```
apps/messaging/providers/
  base.py             MessagingProvider: send(recipient, message, channel,
                      purpose) + SenderIdentity, the school it sends as,
                      + MessagePurpose, which route the message may take
  console.py          the default -- logs it, Sender ID included, and marks
                      it delivered
  termii.py           the gateway: POST /api/sms/send, dnd routing
  bulksmsnigeria.py   kept and working, no longer the default
  africastalking.py   stub: reads AFRICASTALKING_*, builds the payload
  __init__.py         PROVIDERS registry and get_provider()
```

Nothing above `providers/` imports a vendor. Who a message comes from is not the
provider's decision either — see [Each school sends under its own
name](#each-school-sends-under-its-own-name).

The console provider is not a mock — it is the default, deliberately. The whole
feature has to work end to end before anyone signs an SMS contract, and a demo
that dies on a missing API key demos nothing. Every screen, count and delivery
row you see running on it is the same code path a real gateway will drive. An
unknown `MESSAGING_PROVIDER` raises rather than falling back, because a school
that thinks it is sending real SMS must not quietly be writing to a log file.

Africa's Talking remains a stub, complete except for the HTTP call: it reads
its settings, assembles the real payload (it wants `+2348031234567`), takes its
sender from the school's identity like the live providers do, and refuses to
send without credentials instead of returning a false success.

**The abstraction earned itself.** BulkSMS Nigeria declined to support
send-on-behalf-of-schools — one master account, many schools, each under its own
Sender ID — which is the arrangement this platform is built on. Moving to Termii
was a provider file, a default, and a data migration. No view, form, model or
template changed, and `providers/bulksmsnigeria.py` is still there and still
works, because a gateway relationship that ended once can end again.

### Two models

```
Message  --<  MessageRecipient
```

**`Message`** — one press of Send: body, channel, audience description, how the
audience was chosen, sender, provider, a rollup status, and `sent_as` — the
Sender ID the batch actually went out under, snapshotted like the recipients'
phone numbers. A school that renames its Sender ID next term has not
retroactively sent last term's reminders under the new name.

**`MessageRecipient`** — one row per parent, with the phone number and parent
name *snapshotted at send time*, the per-recipient delivery status
(pending / sent / delivered / failed), the provider's reference and any error.
This is what makes the log real: a bursar needs to know that Mrs. Okonkwo's
number bounced, not merely that "JSS 1A parents were messaged".

`sent` and `delivered` are deliberately different states — a gateway accepting a
message says nothing about whether a handset received it.

`Message.status` is the one figure on the platform that is a stored rollup
rather than derived, so the log can be listed and filtered without a join. It is
never set by hand: `refresh_status()` recomputes it from the recipient rows, and
a delivery report arriving days later calls it again. The rows stay the source
of truth.

### Audiences resolve in one place

`apps/messaging/audiences.py` answers three questions that must never disagree —
the live count on the compose screen, the rows actually written, and the
description stored on the message. All three come out of one `resolve()` call,
so the number the bursar saw *is* the batch that went out.

Four filters: all parents at a campus, one class, hand-picked students, and
parents who owe. Students who are not active, students with no number on file,
and every other branch's parents are excluded — and a filter with nothing chosen
resolves to *nobody*, never to everybody.

### "Parents who owe" is the point

The core use case is fee reminders, so `/messaging/reminders/` is the compose
screen with that audience preset and a draft in the body. It selects students
whose confirmed payments do not cover their class's fee structure for the
current term — derived live, like every other fee figure here.

A class with no fee structure this term is **not** chased. Nobody has said what
it costs, so there is no balance, and texting those parents would be the
platform inventing a debt.

`apps/students/fees.py` gets those confirmed amounts from the payments app
through `_paid_amounts()`, which resolves it via the app registry rather than
importing it — so the roster keeps rendering whether or not payments is
installed. See [Payments](#payments).

### Screens

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/messaging/` | The log: audience, channel, when, and "32 sent, 30 delivered, 2 failed". |
| `/messaging/compose/` | Write, pick a channel and an audience, watch the count. |
| `/messaging/reminders/` | The same screen, preset to the parents who owe. |
| `/messaging/<id>/` | One batch, and what happened to every parent's copy. |
| `/messaging/recipients/count/` | JSON, for the live count. |

The live count is a small endpoint rather than a framework, and it runs the same
`resolve()` the send path runs. With scripting off, the count still renders on
load and the form still sends — the endpoint only saves a round trip.

### Each school sends under its own name

The platform (SCHOOLCORD) holds the account with the SMS gateway and pays for
the units. Each school registers its **own** alphanumeric Sender ID against it,
so a parent at Dap Group of Schools sees a message from `Dapgroup`, not from the
platform and not from another school.

**`SchoolMessagingConfig`** — one per school: the Sender ID, the gateway it is
registered with, an approval status, and optional credentials.

```
Platform:   SCHOOLCORD  (holds the Termii master account)
School:     Dap Group of Schools
Sender ID:  Dapgroup
Provider:   Termii
```

`api_key` and `account_reference` are nullable and blank for the pilot: the
master account sends on every school's behalf, under the school's own name. A
school that later takes out its own gateway account fills them in and the send
path does not change — `TermiiProvider.api_key` already prefers the school's key
over the platform's.

`branch` is nullable and part of the uniqueness rule, so a school that later
wants a different Sender ID per campus can have one. A row with no branch is the
school's default; a row with one overrides it for that campus.
`apps/messaging/identity.py` is the only place that ordering is written down.

### Nothing sends under a name that is not the school's

A Sender ID is not usable until a gateway has approved it, so `resolve()` either
returns the school's identity or raises `SenderIdentityUnavailable` with a
sentence naming who fixes it:

* no config at all — "Dap Group of Schools has no Sender ID set up yet…"
* pending — "…is still awaiting approval, so nothing can be sent under it yet."
* rejected / suspended — the same, plus the note the platform recorded.

There is deliberately **no fallback**. Not the platform's name, not a blank
sender, and certainly not another school's: the first two get the batch rejected
by the gateway or ignored by parents, and the third is a tenancy breach a parent
would see on their own handset.

Resolution happens *before* anything is written, so a school that cannot send
gets no `Message` row at all — the log never shows a batch that was never really
sendable. The compose screen catches the same exception and keeps the draft.

### Which gateway carries it

Two decisions, not one:

| | Where it lives | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The school's gateway | `SchoolMessagingConfig.provider` | Where its Sender ID is registered. Two schools can be on two different gateways. |
| The platform override | `MESSAGING_PROVIDER` | When set, it wins over every school's choice. |

`MESSAGING_PROVIDER` defaults to `console`, so a fresh checkout sends nothing
anywhere. Clear it (`MESSAGING_PROVIDER=`) in production and each school goes out
through its own gateway. An override is not a fallback — it is the switch for
development, for tests, and for the day a gateway is down.

The Sender ID travels regardless: on the console provider the log line reads

```
[SMS] from Fulfilled [Fulfilled Academy] via Termii to 08118836702 (transactional): ...
```

— the school's name, the gateway that *would* have carried it, and the message.
That is why per-tenant identity is testable with no credentials and no money
spent.

### Termii

`providers/termii.py` is the live gateway. `POST /api/sms/send` with the school's
Sender ID as `from`, the API key in the body, `type: plain`, and the route in
`channel`. It uses `urllib` from the standard library rather than pulling in
`requests`: one POST with a JSON body does not justify a dependency the school's
server then has to keep patched, and `urllib` gives us the timeout, which is the
part that actually matters when a gateway is slow.

**One recipient per request, deliberately.** Termii has a bulk endpoint taking
an array of numbers, and it returns a single `message_id` for the whole batch.
Every `MessageRecipient` row here carries its own reference and its own status,
and collapsing thirty-two rows onto one id would mean a bursar chasing one
parent could not tell whether that parent's copy was the one that failed.

Their API answers `200` for messages it then refuses, so a 2xx is not on its own
a success: a `code` that is not `ok` is a failure, and so is a success with no
`message_id` — without one there is nothing to reconcile a later delivery report
against. Both response shapes are accepted, since the bulk endpoint answers with
`code` and the single-send endpoint historically has not.

Accepting a message means **sent**, never **delivered** — whether a handset
received it arrives later on their webhook, and reporting it as delivered would
make the log lie about the one thing a bursar chasing a parent needs it for.

A master-account balance under 100 units logs a warning on every send. Units
running out stops every school on the platform at once, and the first anyone
would otherwise know is a batch of failures.

### Transactional or promotional — the routing that has to be right

Nigerian gateways carry two routes, and picking the wrong one does not fail
loudly. It silently fails to arrive.

| | Termii channel | Reaches DND numbers | 8pm–8am |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transactional | `dnd` | yes | allowed |
| Promotional | `generic` | no | refused |
| *(WhatsApp)* | `whatsapp` | n/a | n/a |

Most Nigerian subscribers have Do-Not-Disturb switched on. A fee reminder put on
`generic` reaches perhaps a third of the parents it was addressed to, at an hour
of the school's choosing, and reports success for all of them — the school
believes it has chased the debt. So `Message.purpose` is a stored field, it
defaults to transactional, and `TermiiProvider.termii_channel` is written as
"generic **if** promotional, else dnd" rather than as a lookup table: every value
that is not the one promotional case — a blank, a typo, a purpose added later
and not thought about — lands on the route that arrives.

The compose screen asks, with transactional preselected, and the form's
`clean_purpose` applies the same rule so the stored purpose agrees with what was
actually sent. `purpose` is read off the batch at delivery, not passed in, so a
send resumed days later is routed exactly as its first half was. The message log
shows the route it went out on, which is what answers "why did only half these
parents get it?".

BulkSMS Nigeria expresses the same split as its numeric `dnd` flag rather than
as a named route, so a promotional send there drops to `dnd=0`.

**The channel is the first question, the purpose the second.**
`termii_channel` took a `channel` argument and ignored it, so a message on
`Channel.WHATSAPP` was handed an SMS route. `dnd` and `generic` are two
delivery classes of SMS; `whatsapp` is a different destination, and none of
what separates the SMS pair — the Do-Not-Disturb register, the overnight
curfew — exists on it. What WhatsApp prices and polices is the template's own
category, fixed when the template was approved, so a purpose has nothing to
say about it.

Nothing shipped through that bug: WhatsApp goes out through
`TermiiWhatsAppProvider`, whose endpoint and payload are different and which
never calls this method. It was wrong waiting to be reached.

### BulkSMS Nigeria — kept, not the default

`providers/bulksmsnigeria.py` is complete and still tested. A school already
registered there keeps sending there, and `MESSAGING_PROVIDER=bulksmsnigeria`
moves the whole platform back. Keeping a working integration that has stopped
being the default is the point of the interface — deleting it is how you find
out a year later that you cannot go back.

Migration `0004_move_configs_to_termii` moved existing school configs across.
**It resets approved Sender IDs to pending**, on purpose: an approval is a fact
about one gateway, and BulkSMS Nigeria having approved "Fulfilled" says nothing
about whether Termii has. Carrying the status over would have the platform claim
a registration that does not exist and bounce the first batch. Each moved row
keeps its Sender ID and gets a note telling the school what happened; a platform
administrator re-approves once Termii has registered the name.

### The identity screen

`/messaging/identity/` serves two readers at different scopes. A school sees its
own Sender ID, the gateway, the approval status, and a preview of how it lands
on a parent's handset. The platform owner sees every school — **including the
ones with nothing registered**, since a roll that only lists the schools already
set up hides exactly the ones needing action — and registers or approves from
`/messaging/identity/<school>/edit/`.

| | View own identity | Register & approve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bursar | | |
| Principal | yes | |
| School owner | yes | |
| Platform owner | yes | yes |

Approving is platform-only because the platform is the party that actually
submits a Sender ID to the gateway. A school approving its own would be marking
its own homework, and the gateway would reject the first message anyway.

Two schools cannot register the same Sender ID: gateways do let unrelated
accounts hold similar names, but on one platform it means parents cannot tell
which school texted them, and it is almost always a copy-paste from the row
above.

### Seeding

```bash
python manage.py seed_messaging_identity          # Fulfilled Academy -> "Fulfilled"
python manage.py seed_messaging_identity --school "Dap Group of Schools" \
    --sender-id Dapgroup --provider termii
python manage.py seed_messaging_identity --pending  # seed the blocked state
```

### Permissions

Bursar, principal and owner can all send. Messaging is the one place a bursar is
not read-only, and the reason is the job: chasing a fee is their work. Nothing in
messaging edits school data — it only reads the roster they can already see.

Nothing new is seeded; messaging runs off the existing students and their parent
contacts.

## Payments

At `/payments/`. The core of the product, and for the pilot it is **manual**:
the school keeps banking into its own account and the bursar records each
payment against a student. No gateway, no card, no settlement.

### One model

**`Payment`** — branch-owned, belongs to a student and a term. Amount, date
paid, label, method, reference, source, status, an optional receipt
attachment, and the audit trail (recorded / confirmed / voided, by whom and
when).

Two fields exist now specifically so a later change is not a rewrite:

* **`source`** — manual / gateway / bank-import. Every row is manual today.
  When a gateway or a bank-statement import starts creating rows, the ones a
  human typed stay distinguishable from the ones a machine reconciled, which is
  the first question anyone will ask when the two disagree.
* **`gateway_provider` / `gateway_reference`** — null on every row, waiting.

`term` is a foreign key rather than something worked out from the date: a
payment made in the holidays for next term is still that term's money, and only
the person recording it knows which.

### Balance is derived, never stored

```
expected = the class's FeeStructure total for the term
paid     = the sum of that student's CONFIRMED payments for that term
balance  = expected - paid
```

Not on the student, not on the term, not on the payment. It lives in
`apps/payments/balances.py` and is computed every time it is asked. Because
`paid_by_student()` is the single definition of "paid", confirming a receipt or
voiding a payment moves the student's balance, the outstanding list, the
bursar's dashboard and messaging's "parents who owe" in the same instant, with
no recalculation step anywhere.

Status derives too: **paid** (balance ≤ 0), **partial**, **unpaid**, and
**overdue** — which is not a fifth state but unpaid-or-partial past the term's
`due_date`. A term with no due date set never produces it: a deadline nobody
stated is not one a parent can have missed. The four existing payment-status
colours carry all of them.

An overpayment is a credit, not a negative balance.

### Only confirmed money counts

`pending` is the receipt handed in but not yet checked — the client's flow of
"someone uploads a receipt, the bursar confirms who and what it is for". A
pending payment sits in the queue, shows on the student's page, and changes no
balance at all until someone confirms it. The confirm step is the *same form*
as recording, deliberately: the bursar has to be able to correct the student,
the label and the amount against the slip at the moment they confirm.

### Labelling is descriptive

School Fees / Uniform / Books / Development / Other, set from the receipt or
from what the parent said. It does **not** split the balance — that stays one
combined figure. Per-label accounting would mean deciding what happens when a
parent pays 50,000 against a 30,000 uniform charge, and nobody has asked for
that answer.

### A voided payment is never deleted

It keeps its row, stops counting, and records who voided it and why. Voiding
asks for a reason and a tickbox, and the screen shows what the balance will
become before you press it. Money that was recorded and then reversed is a fact
about the account; erasing it is how a ledger stops being one.

Students are protected too: a student with payments against them cannot be
deleted from the roster — the screen says so and offers "withdraw instead",
which keeps the history and stops the billing.

### Screens

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/payments/` | Branch-wide list, filterable by label, status, method and date, with confirmed and pending totals for the filter. |
| `/payments/record/` | Record a payment. Student picked by typing; balance shown beside the amount. |
| `/payments/pending/` | The receipt queue: the slip alongside the figures it has to agree with. |
| `/payments/outstanding/` | Who owes, most owed first, with one click to message them. |
| `/payments/<id>/` | One payment, its attachment, its trail, and the balance it moved. |
| `/payments/<id>/receipt/` | A printable receipt with the running balance. |
| `/payments/<id>/void/` | Reverse it, with a reason. |
| `/payments/student/<id>/` | A student's full history. Their detail page shows the most recent eight. |

The student picker is a text input backed by a native `<datalist>`, not a long
`<select>` or a JS autocomplete: it is how the job is actually done — the bursar
has a receipt with an admission number on it and types it — and the browser's
own search matches a surname too. The receipt is plain HTML with a print
stylesheet rather than a generated PDF; the browser already knows how to print
and how to save as PDF, and a PDF library would be a dependency the school has
to keep working for a page that is one page long. That judgement still stands for
this page. It does not extend to [Reports](#reports), where the export is a filed
document rather than a single page.

### Permissions

| | View | Record & confirm | Void |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bursar | yes | yes | |
| Principal | yes | yes | yes |
| School owner | yes | yes | yes |

Voiding is supervisory: it reverses confirmed money. If the school would rather
the bursar could undo their own mistakes, add `VOID_PAYMENTS` to `_BURSAR` in
`apps/core/permissions.py` — the screens follow the capability table and nothing
else changes.

### Seeding

```bash
python manage.py seed_payments            # needs seed_students to have run
python manage.py seed_payments --replace  # clear this term's payments and reseed
```

The spread is chosen so every state is actually on screen: students paid in
full (in one payment and in two instalments), part paid, untouched, two pending
receipts with attachments, and one voided payment with its reason. Amounts come
from each student's own class fee structure rather than being hard-coded, so
re-pricing a class re-seeds sensible figures.

**Overdue is the one status the seed does not produce, and cannot.** It is a
property of the *term*, not of a student: the moment a term's `due_date` is in
the past, every unpaid and part-paid balance at that branch turns overdue at
once. Seeding one would therefore hide the unpaid and part-paid states behind a
wall of red rather than adding a fourth colour beside them. Set a due date on
the term (Django admin → Terms) and the overdue pill appears everywhere it
should. The behaviour itself is covered by tests in
`apps/payments/tests.py::OverdueTests`.

## Modules: what each school has

Three questions decide whether an account can reach a screen, and they are
deliberately separate:

| Question | Answered by |
| --- | --- |
| *Which rows?* | Tenancy — `apps/core/tenancy.py` |
| *Which actions?* | Capabilities — `apps/core/permissions.py` |
| *Which features does this school have at all?* | Modules — `apps/core/modules.py` |

A module is a commercial fact about a school, not a permission. Admissions is a
paid add-on; parent messaging costs the platform money per message. A school that
has not taken them should not see them and should not be able to reach them by
typing a URL — but none of that is a statement about the principal doing the
typing, which is why it cannot live in the capability table.

### The registry is the only declaration

`apps/core/modules.py` holds one `Module` per feature: its URL prefixes, the
capabilities it owns, its default, and whether it can be switched off at all.
Adding a module means adding an entry there and nothing else — no migration, no
second list of names anywhere in the codebase.

| Module | Paths | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `academics` | `/academics/` | always on |
| `students` | `/students/` | always on |
| `fees` | `/fees/`, `/payments/`, `/reports/` | always on |
| `messaging` | `/messaging/` | **off** |
| `admissions` | `/admissions/`, and the school's public enquiry page | **off** |

The always-on three are what the product *is*: a school with no student records,
no fees and no classes is not a school. `SchoolModule.set_state` refuses to record
a decision about them, and a stale row claiming otherwise is ignored.

### Absent means "nobody has decided"

`SchoolModule` stores *decisions*, not state. With no row, a school gets the
registry default — so a school that signs up this morning needs nothing written
for it, and changing a default later moves every school that never chose. Writing
a row is how the platform owner overrides that, in either direction, and the screen
shows which of the two a switch currently is (`Platform default` against a chip).

A key the registry does not recognise — a module since renamed or removed — is
ignored rather than obeyed. The registry is the authority on what exists.

### Enforcement is in four places, each because it knows something the others don't

1. **`ModuleAccessMiddleware`** gates the URL prefixes for the caller's own school.
   A middleware rather than a view mixin, deliberately: the requirement is that a
   switched-off module is *never* reachable by typing its URL, and a mixin delivers
   that only for as long as everybody remembers to add one. Matching on the prefix
   means a screen added under `/admissions/` tomorrow is gated today. A test asserts
   exactly that, against a URL that does not exist.
2. **`capabilities_of(user)`** withdraws the module's capabilities. This is what
   closes the doors drawn on *other* modules' screens — the fee-reminder button on
   the bursar's dashboard is a messaging action sitting on a payments page, and the
   middleware guarding `/messaging/` cannot reach it. Withdrawal, not absence:
   `capabilities_for(role)` stays the pure answer, because a capability is a fact
   about a role.
3. **`nav_for(...)`** drops the module's nav entries, so the sidebar never offers a
   door the middleware would shut. `NavItem.module` is the third gate beside
   `roles` and `capability`, and like `capabilities` it defaults to empty — a
   caller that does not pass it gets less, not more.
4. **The school's public enquiry page** checks for itself, in
   `SchoolFromSlugMixin`. It belongs to the school named in the URL rather than to
   the reader, and usually nobody is signed in at all: the middleware knows the
   caller's school, and only that mixin knows the page's.

### What a refusal looks like

A staff URL answers **403** with `templates/403_module.html` — which names the
feature, says who can switch it on, and says that nothing has been deleted, because
that is the first thing a school asks. Deliberately not the ordinary 403 page: a
permission refusal is about the account, and this one is not.

The public enquiry page answers **404**. To a parent with a link from Instagram
there is no such page, and a signed-out stranger is owed no account of which
features a school has bought.

### Nothing is deleted

Switching a module off hides it and closes its screens. The rows stay, the code
stays, the URLs stay routed. Switching it back on the same afternoon restores every
screen exactly as it was — one row written, no migration, no redeploy, and the
answer moves inside the same request cycle. A test switches admissions off with an
applicant on the board and finds them still there when it comes back on.

### Only the platform owner switches them

`MANAGE_SCHOOL_MODULES` is granted in `_PLATFORM` and nowhere else. It is the one
capability deliberately absent from a school owner's set, and for a commercial
reason rather than a technical one: a proprietor who could turn on the admissions
add-on would be deciding their own bill. A school owner gets a 403 from the school
detail screen — including for their own school — and from the toggle endpoint.

### The platform owner's screens

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/platform/` | Every school as a card: its own logo, its plan and status, its counts, and a chip per switchable module showing on *or* off. The whole card is the link. |
| `/platform/schools/<id>/` | One school: identity, figures, the module switches, its campuses and their current terms, who can sign in, and a link to its collections report. |
| `/platform/schools/<id>/modules/` | POST only. Switches one module. |

`/platform/` used to be a table of counts, which was the wrong shape for the job:
the platform owner does not arrive to read numbers, they arrive to pick a school and
do something to it. **Schools** in the sidebar points here now rather than at the
Django admin changelist — the admin is neither tenant-aware nor the place to make a
commercial decision from, though `SchoolModule` is registered there for the question
the admin is good at: when did this change, and who changed it.

Each switch is its own form, and it POSTs the state it wants rather than "flip it".
A toggle that flipped whatever it found would do the wrong thing the moment somebody
double-submitted or pressed the switch in a tab that had gone stale. A POST rather
than a link, because a GET that changed what a school pays for would be followed by
every crawler and prefetcher on the internet — a test asserts the endpoint answers
405 to a GET.

### The pilot

Fulfilled Academy is recorded with messaging and the full admissions pipeline
**off**, and fees, student records and classes **on** — by
`schools/migrations/0004_pilot_module_state.py`, which is keyed on the school's name,
guarded by an `exists()` so it is inert where that school is absent, idempotent, and
reversible.

It writes rows for a state the registry defaults would produce anyway, and that is
the point: a default is what the platform does when nobody has decided, and somebody
*has* decided here. Leaving it implied would mean a later change of default silently
switching a live school's features on, mid-term, with an SMS bill attached.

## Reports

The dashboards answer "how are we doing?" at a glance. Reports answers "show me".
Everything detailed enough to need a table or a second chart moved off the four
dashboards and onto `/reports/`, which each one now links to.

### One structure, two renderers

`apps/reports/reporting.py` builds a `Report` — headline figures, two charts, the
breakdowns, and the notes that keep them from being misread. The page and the PDF
each walk that same structure and neither computes anything, which is the only
reason a printed figure can be trusted to match the screen. A third renderer would
need no changes to the builder.

`apps/reports/structure.py` is the contract: `Stat`, `Chart`, `Segment`, `Table`,
`Column`, `Cell`. It imports nothing that knows about output. A `Cell` carries its
figure already formatted in both spellings it needs — `₦102,000` for the
screen, `NGN 102,000` for print — and `prose()` does the same for a sentence
with money in it.

### It defines nothing of its own

| Question | Answered by |
| --- | --- |
| What is a child expected to pay, and which state are they in? | `apps/students/fees.py` |
| What counts as money received? | `apps/payments/` via `apps/core/finance.py` |
| Who still owes? | `apps/payments/balances.py::outstanding` |

The report only *groups* those answers — by school, campus, class, method, month
— and formats them. `apps/core/finance.py` is new but not: `collection_summary`,
`with_outstanding` and `status_breakdown` moved there out of `core/views.py` and
grew a plural, so the four dashboards and the report read the same three functions.
`from apps.core.views import status_breakdown` still works.

### Two figures that are deliberately not the same thing

The report says this in its own notes rather than quietly picking one:

- **Collected**, wherever money is totalled, is every confirmed payment credited
  to the term. The till question, the same figure the bursar's dashboard shows,
  and it adds up: the campus rows sum to the headline.
- **Still owed**, on the outstanding table, is what the *current roster* has left
  to pay. The chase question. It parts company with expected-less-collected when a
  child who has paid has since left, or a parent has overpaid.

### Scope, not permission

`VIEW_PAYMENTS` gates the screen, and every role holds it — a bursar collects
against these figures, a principal and a proprietor answer for them. What differs
between roles is what the report *covers*, and the scoped managers have already
settled that before `resolve_scope` runs:

| Role | Covers | Picker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bursar / Principal | their campus | none — a select with one option is not a choice |
| School owner | every campus they run | campus |
| Platform owner | every school | school, then campus |

A school or branch id typed into the query string is matched against the
tenant-scoped querysets. An id that is not there counts as *not chosen* rather than
as an error, so a caller can neither widen their scope nor earn a 404 for trying
— they get their own report.

**There is no term picker, on purpose.** Every campus is measured against its own
current term. A proprietor mid-transition has two terms in flight, and pricing one
campus against another's calendar would overstate one and understate the other.

### Screens

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/reports/` | The collections report: six figures, two charts, seven breakdowns, and the small print. |
| `/reports/collections.pdf` | The same report as a download, carrying the same query string. |

The breakdowns are: by school (platform scope), by campus, by class, payment status
by class, how the money came in, what it was recorded against, when it arrived, and
the twenty largest outstanding balances. Each carries a footnote saying what it
leaves out, because every one of them leaves something out.

### The PDF, and the receipt that is not one

`ReceiptView` prints from the browser and deliberately does not generate a PDF, on
the grounds that a browser already knows how to print one page. That reasoning
holds for one page and stops holding for a report, which somebody files, emails to
a bank or hands to a board: it needs a fixed page size, repeating table headers,
page numbers and a filename, and none of those survive "Ctrl-P, save as PDF" intact
across four browsers. So ReportLab is a dependency, confined to
`apps/reports/pdf.py` — nothing else in the codebase imports it. Pillow arrives
with it and is not otherwise used.

**Why the PDF says `NGN` where the screen says `₦`.** The fourteen fonts every
PDF reader has built in are Latin-1, and `₦` (U+20A6) is not in Latin-1.
ReportLab does not refuse a character it cannot encode — it silently substitutes
ZapfDingbats — so the first draft of this export rendered every amount as a
dingbat, with nothing in any log to say so. Embedding a font for one character is a
file the school then has to keep shipped and licensed, so the report prints the ISO
code, which is what a bank statement does too. A test asserts no substitute font
ever appears in the output.

The charts are drawn: `StackedBar` is a ReportLab `Flowable` filling rectangles in
the app's own status colours, copied into `pdf.py` as hex because a PDF has no CSS
custom properties. They are the light-theme values, since paper is white. Every
segment drawn is also named and counted in a legend underneath — on paper as on
screen, hue is never the only signal.

### What the dashboards kept

Each keeps its summary figures and exactly one chart, plus anything that is an
*alert* rather than a breakdown — a campus with no current term, a class carrying
children with no fee against their name. Those are holes in the figures beside
them, not detail to go and look up.

| Dashboard | Keeps | Moved to Reports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/finance/` | Three money figures, the collection meter | The roster's four states, "What each class is worth" |
| `/school/` | Three counts, the four-state breakdown | "Your campuses" |
| `/branch/` | Three counts, the four-state breakdown | "Classes on this campus" |

## Admissions and enquiries

A paid add-on beyond the original scope. It is the pipeline a prospective child
travels from the moment their parent taps a link on Instagram to the moment they
appear on the register.

### An applicant is its own entity, not a draft student

This is the decision everything else follows from. A `Student` is a child on the
roll: billed, counted in the head count, present in every report. A child whose
parent filled in a form at midnight is none of those things, and the moment the
two share a table every `Student.objects` query in the platform starts returning
people who have never set foot in the school.

So `Applicant` is its own model, and enrolment is a **conversion**:
`apps/admissions/enrolment.py` creates the Student and links back to the
applicant, which keeps its whole history. `applicant.student` is the link;
`student.applicant` is the reverse.

### One record, many stages

An enquiry does not become a different row when it becomes an application. The
status advances and the application stage *adds* fields:

```
enquiry ── application ── assessed ── offered ── enrolled
   │                                     └───── rejected
   ├── expired
   └── withdrawn (from any open stage)
```

`ApplicationForm` is a ModelForm over the same row, and every field the parent
already gave is deliberately **absent** from it — there is nowhere on that
screen to retype a date of birth, so there is nowhere for the two copies to
disagree. What the screen does show, at the top, is a read-only "carried over
from the enquiry" panel, so the person filling it in can see the data is there.

Nothing is ever deleted. A rejected applicant, a lapsed enquiry and a family who
changed their mind are all facts about the intake — a school asking in March how
many enquiries January's post brought and how many converted needs the ones that
did not.

### The public enquiry page

`/<school-slug>/enquiry/` — the URL a school puts in its Instagram bio, its
WhatsApp status or on its own website.

It is the second place on the platform, after signup, that runs with **no tenant
context at all**. A parent is anonymous, so every scoped manager would return
nothing: an empty campus list, an empty class list. Every queryset there
therefore goes through `all_objects` and is narrowed by hand to the school in
the URL — and *that narrowing is the security boundary*. The school comes from
the slug, never from anything the browser posts, which is why posting another
school's branch or class id is refused rather than honoured.

**The page is branded to the school and to nothing else.** It does not extend
`base.html`, because that template puts the product name in the title and the
product mark in the header — right for staff, wrong for a parent who has come to
enquire about *their school*. The school's name is the title, its uploaded logo
is the mark, and SCHOOLCORD appears nowhere. A test asserts that.

The form is deliberately light — top of funnel only. Child's name, date of
birth, sex, campus, class wanted, parent name, phone, email, previous school and
how they heard about the school. A parent still deciding whether to enquire will
abandon a form that asks for a birth certificate.

Branch is a real, required field here, because the parent is outside the system
and nothing else can know which campus they mean. On the staff walk-in form at
`/admissions/new/` it is not asked at all: the person at the desk is standing in
the campus the parent walked into, so it comes from their account. Both forms
write to the same model, and differ only in `source`.

### The validity window

A fresh enquiry is good for a number of days set per school (21 by default), and
`expires_at` is stamped on the first save. Two nightly commands act on it:

```bash
python manage.py send_enquiry_reminders   # run this one first
python manage.py expire_enquiries
```

`send_enquiry_reminders` emails the parent once, after the school's own
`reminder_after_days` (7 by default). `reminder_sent_at` is stamped **only on
success**, so a send that failed is retried tomorrow rather than silently marked
done — and never more than once per enquiry, because a second and third
identical email is how a school's mail starts being marked as spam.

`expire_enquiries` closes what has lapsed. It only ever expires rows still at
the *enquiry* stage: once a family has filled in the application the window has
done its job, and expiring somebody mid-assessment would be the platform closing
a door the school is holding open. Both commands take `--dry-run`.

`applicant.has_lapsed` is derived, not stored, so the board is honest the moment
a window closes rather than only after the sweep has run.

### Requirements are data, per level

The client's rule is not one list. A passport photograph is asked of every
applicant; an entrance examination is asked of Primary and Secondary and never
of Nursery; the supporting documents differ again between a four-year-old
starting Pre-KG and a fifteen-year-old transferring into SSS 2.

So the requirement set is data rather than a chain of `if level ==`. Three
layers answer "what does this applicant owe us?", narrowest first:

1. the branch's own `RequirementSet` for that level,
2. the school's set for that level (`branch` null — one policy, every campus),
3. the defaults in `apps/admissions/requirements.py`.

`requirements.profile_for(level, school=, branch=)` is the only function any
caller needs. A school that has configured nothing gets a complete, sensible
answer; a school that disagrees with one line changes that line.

| Level | Photo | Birth cert. | Previous results | Transfer letter | Entrance exam |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nursery | required | required | not asked | not asked | **no** |
| Primary | required | required | required | optional | yes |
| Junior Secondary | required | required | required | required | yes |
| Senior Secondary | required | required | required | required | yes |

Nursery does not list previous results *at all* — not even as optional. A
four-year-old has no previous school to produce a report from, and offering the
upload would be asking for something that does not exist.

The assessment screen 404s for a level that does not sit one. Skipping the exam
is a URL that does not exist for that applicant, not a hidden button, so a
bookmarked link cannot create a record the level has no use for.

**Document fields are never hard-required on the form.** The front desk types
the application while the parent goes to photocopy the birth certificate, and a
form that refused to save until every paper was in hand would send them back to
the paper book this feature exists to replace. "Required" is enforced where it
matters — `applicant.missing_requirements`, which the detail screen lists and
the decision screen shows the principal before they decide.

#### The school edits them, not the admin

`/admissions/requirements/` lists what each level asks for and, for the school
owner, edits it. Previously the only way to change a `RequirementSet` was the
Django admin — so the policy belonged to whoever had a shell rather than to the
proprietor whose school it is.

Each line has **three** states, not two, because "optional" and "not asked" are
different answers: an optional transfer letter is requested and shown on the
checklist but never blocks a decision, while one that is not asked for is off
the form altogether. The entrance exam is the exception — it offers only
*sits it* / *does not*, since `requires_assessment` reads `is_required` and an
"optional exam" would be a line the pipeline ignores while the screen implies
it matters.

Saving writes the **school-wide** set (`branch` null). Campus-level overrides
remain a thing the model supports and `profile_for` resolves, but they are not
offered from a screen — one policy across every campus is the case schools
actually have. **Reset to default** deletes the set, so the built-in policy
applies again; it is POST-only, because a link a prefetch could follow must not
undo a school's configuration.

Only the school owner writes it (`manage_admission_requirements`, held by
school owner and platform owner). A principal runs the pipeline *under* the
rules and reads them; that is the line the client drew.

### Admission fees are not termly fees

`fees.FeeStructure` is what a class owes **per term** and is repriced every
term. What a family pays to come in is charged **once**, at the door, and
includes items — uniform, tracksuit, the book list — a returning child never
pays again. Sharing a table would mean every termly total silently gaining an
admission fee.

So they are separate models with separate seeders, and neither command can touch
the other's rows:

| | Termly | Admission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set | `fees.FeeStructure` | `admissions.AdmissionFeeSchedule` |
| Line | `fees.FeeComponent` | `admissions.AdmissionFeeItem` |
| Money | `payments.Payment` (needs a Student) | `admissions.AdmissionPayment` (needs only an Applicant) |
| Source | `apps/fees/pricing.py` | `apps/admissions/admission_pricing.py` |
| Seeder | `seed_fees` | `seed_admission_fees` |

`AdmissionPayment` exists because `payments.Payment` requires a `Student`, and
the whole point of an admission fee is that it is paid by a family who does not
have one yet. They stay separate after enrolment too, so a term's collection
figure never quietly includes intake money. Tests assert the separation from
both sides.

Line items carry a `kind`: `admission` (the one-time fee, and the only thing
enrolment is gated on), `intake` (tuition, uniform, sportswear, exam/dossier,
tracksuit) and `books` (the compulsory book list, quoted as a separate add-on
and excluded from "due at intake").

Totals are never stored. `compulsory_total`, `admission_total`, `books_total`
and `total` are all summed from the live line items, the same rule the termly
structure follows.

```bash
python manage.py seed_admission_fees --school "Fulfilled Academy" --branch "Main Campus"
```

**The seeder refuses to price a sheet whose figures it does not have**, and
names the missing lines instead. Seeding a zero would put a real-looking 0 in
front of a parent and inventing a plausible figure would put a wrong one there;
both are worse than a command that says which number it is waiting for. Fill the
amounts into `admission_pricing.py` (replace each `PENDING` with `naira(...)`)
and re-run.

Where the school's own written total disagrees with its line items, the seeder
charges the line items and prints a warning — no balancing line is invented.
That is how Primary 1's 2,000 gap is handled in the termly file, and it is how
the Pre-KG–KG3 gap is handled here: the sheet's written total is 81,000 while
its own items sum to 82,000, and `client_total` records that so the warning
fires the moment the figures land.

### Enrolment

On an offer plus a confirmed admission fee, `enrolment.enrol()` creates the
Student in one transaction: names, sex, date of birth, parent contact and
address copied across, admission number suggested from the branch's own series
(`AS/2026/008` — the school's initials, the year, the next free number), class
taken from the offer unless the front desk places them elsewhere.

`enrol` calls `student.full_clean()` with **nothing excluded**, and that is
load-bearing. The roster's uniqueness rule is
`UniqueConstraint(Upper("admission_number"), "branch")`, and Django skips a
constraint that mentions an excluded field — excluding `branch` (the obvious
thing to do, since it is derived rather than typed) would silently turn the
check off and let a duplicate through to the database as a 500.

`enrolment.can_enrol()` returns *every* blocker as a list rather than raising on
the first, so the screen shows all of them at once instead of revealing them one
refresh at a time. The payment gate is a per-school setting: a school that
admits first and collects afterwards turns it off.

### Who does what

| | Owner / Principal | Bursar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| See the pipeline | yes | **configurable**, off by default |
| Move an applicant along | yes | never |
| Offer or refuse a place | yes | **never**, whatever is configured |
| See admission fees | yes | yes |
| Record an admission payment | yes | yes |

Every other capability on the platform is a fixed property of the role. This one
is not, because whether a bursar sees applicants is the *school's* decision —
some run the front desk out of the bursary, most do not. So
`AdmissionsConfig.bursar_can_view_applicants` widens *viewing* only, and
`apps/admissions/access.py` is the one place that ordering is expressed: the
role table is the ceiling, and the school's toggle can only ever move a bursar
up to reading the board.

The sidebar consults the same answer the views do (`NavItem.capability`), so it
never offers a bursar a link that would 403.

### What the parent receives

Three emails, all signed by the school. The platform is named nowhere in the
body, and the one place it cannot be hidden — the envelope sender — carries the
school's *display name* over our address, with `Reply-To` set to the school's
own office email so a parent hitting reply reaches the school. Sending as
`@theschool.com` from our servers would fail that domain's SPF and land in spam,
which helps nobody.

| Email | When |
| --- | --- |
| Acknowledgement | immediately on a public submission — carries the reference and the closing date |
| Reminder | once, inside the window |
| Decision | on an offer or a refusal, if the person deciding asks for it |

The offer and the refusal are two templates, not one with the adjectives
swapped. An offer tells the family what to do next and what is payable at
intake; a refusal is short, says the decision is final for this intake, and does
not dangle a reconsideration the school has not offered.

Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so the reminder can build an absolute link back to the
school's enquiry page. Left blank the link is omitted rather than sent broken.

### The screens

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/<school-slug>/enquiry/` | The school's public enquiry page. Unauthenticated. |
| `/admissions/` | The pipeline board — every applicant grouped by stage, filterable by campus, level, class and status. |
| `/admissions/new/` | Walk-in enquiry, branch taken from the staff account. |
| `/admissions/<id>/` | One applicant: what is captured, what is outstanding, what is next. |
| `/admissions/<id>/application/` | Enquiry to application. Adds fields, re-asks for none. |
| `/admissions/<id>/assessment/` | Schedule or record the entrance exam. 404s for a level that does not sit one. |
| `/admissions/<id>/decision/` | Offer or refuse. Owner and principal only. |
| `/admissions/<id>/enrol/` | The conversion. |
| `/admissions/<id>/payment/` | Record an admission payment. |
| `/admissions/fees/` | The intake fee sheets and what has been collected. |
| `/admissions/settings/` | The window, the reminder, and who sees the pipeline. |

## The public side and signing in

Everything above assumed you were already signed in. This is how you get there.

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Landing page. Public; a signed-in visitor is redirected to their dashboard. |
| `/signup/` | Creates a School, its first Branch and the owner User, then signs them in. |
| `/welcome/` | The four-step onboarding checklist. |
| `/accounts/login/` | Sign in with an email address or a username, landing each role on its own dashboard. |
| `/accounts/settings/` | Account settings: anyone's own email address and password. In every role's sidebar. |
| `/privacy/` | The privacy policy. Public, and readable signed in as well as out. |
| `/accounts/password_change/` | Redirects to Account settings. |
| `/accounts/password_reset/` | Django's reset flow; the console backend prints the link in dev. |
| `/dashboard/` | Not a screen — forwards to whichever dashboard the role belongs on. |

### The landing page

`templates/core/landing.html`, in order: hero, the problem, the answer to it,
how setup goes, questions, the ask, the footer. The sticky bar
(`partials/_lp_nav.html`) jumps to the middle four, so the page is both a scroll
and a menu. Smooth scrolling and the offset that keeps a heading clear of the
bar are declared in CSS (`scroll-behavior` / `scroll-padding-top`), so the links
work with the keyboard, in a new tab, and with the page's JavaScript blocked;
`js/ui.js` only adds the bar's scrolled state and the `aria-current` that marks
the section being read.

The hero's floating cards (`core/_hero_cards.html`) are **not screenshots**:
they are real fragments of the interface, built from the same tokens,
components and payment-status colours the app itself uses. A screenshot goes
stale the week after it is taken and cannot follow the theme; this follows both
for free.

The classroom background is treated entirely in CSS, so swapping the
photograph changes one attribute and nothing else. `.hero-photo` throws the
original colour away (`grayscale`), re-tints it to a single hue and rotates
that hue to the brand blue (`sepia` + `hue-rotate` — a plain `saturate` cannot
move a hue, only weaken it), then darkens and blurs. The supplied photograph is
lit warm gold; none of that survives.

`.hero-wash` adds a left-hand scrim over the result, and that one is load-
bearing rather than decorative: the headline column sits on the left and the
classroom's sunlit window wall lands directly under it, so without the scrim
the brightest part of the picture is exactly where the white type goes.

The blur is **atmosphere, not a privacy mechanism** — a CSS filter is a
rendering choice and can be switched off. The rule lives on the asset instead,
documented on `LandingView.HERO_IMAGE`: an empty room, desks or a chalkboard,
never an identifiable child. Set that constant to `None` and the template omits
the `<img>` rather than pointing at a placeholder; the gradient underneath is a
finished hero on its own.

One upside of blurring at that radius: the asset does not need to be large.
The committed file is 1024×685 and ~123 KB, and upscaling it across a wide
display is invisible under a 10px blur.

Every section below the hero carries `.lazy-section` (`content-visibility:
auto`), so the browser skips its layout and paint until it is nearly on screen
— the cheapest form of lazy-loading a section, with no script and no
placeholder. Reveals are armed from JS against markup that ships **visible**, so
the failure mode of the whole effect is "no animation", never "no content".

### Branches, Staff and Terms are screens, not admin links

These three sat in the sidebar as Django admin URLs, which meant the proprietor
— whose account is deliberately **not** `is_staff` — followed a link in their
own sidebar to the admin login page. Granting `is_staff` would have been worse:
the admin is not tenant-scoped, so it would have put another school's rows one
URL away.

| URL | What it is | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/branches/` | The school's campuses, with add and edit. | Read: owner, principal. Change: owner and platform (`manage_branches`). |
| `/staff/` | Who can sign in, and as what. | Read: owner, principal (`view_staff`). |
| `/fees/terms/` | Terms, including which one the school is in now. | Read: everyone who reads fees. Change: `manage_fees`. |

Fee structures needed no change — both the platform owner and the school owner
already held `view_fees` and `manage_fees`. `apps/core/tests_role_access.py`
signs in as each role and follows the sidebar links, asserting on what comes
back and that no href is an `/admin/` URL; that is the check the suite lacked,
because every existing test asked whether the *view* allowed the role and the
view in question was Django's.

#### Creating staff accounts

`/staff/new/` is where a proprietor gives a colleague a login. Before it, every
account after the first came from somebody with a shell running
`invite_school_owner` — fine for the first owner, since there is nobody at the
school yet, and wrong for everyone after.

* **No password field.** The account gets a long random password nobody sees —
  not even the proprietor creating it — and the person sets their own from the
  emailed link, the same `send_set_password_email` the invite command uses and
  the same message "forgot password" produces. Random rather than unusable:
  Django's reset form skips accounts with an unusable password, which would
  shut the only door.
* **Permission role and job title stay separate.** The role decides access; the
  title is what they do. A bursar promoted to "Head of Finance" gains nothing.
* **Assignable roles are school owner, principal and bursar.** `platform_owner`
  is absent from the choices *and* rejected in `clean_role`, so a hand-rolled
  POST cannot mint one. Platform staff come from `create_platform_owner`.
* **Tenant-scoped by construction.** The school is never a form field — it is
  read from the signed-in account — so a posted `school` is ignored, and the
  campus dropdown runs through the scoped manager, so another school's campus
  is not selectable and is rejected if sent by hand.
* A branch-scoped role (principal, bursar) must name a campus; an owner account
  stores none, because an owner sees them all.

The invite email is sent **outside** the transaction that creates the account:
a mail failure must not roll back a user the proprietor has just been told
about. If it fails they are warned, and **Resend invite** on the staff list is
the fix — itself scoped, so an id from another tenant is a 404 rather than an
email to a stranger.

`apps/accounts/tests_staff_provisioning.py` follows the emailed link to the
end: sets a password, signs in with it, checks the new bursar lands on the
screens their role allows and is refused the ones it does not, and that the
link is single-use.

### The privacy policy

`/privacy/` is written for Nigeria's NDPA: the **school is the data
controller**, SCHOOLCORD is the **processor**, plus what is held, who it is
shared with, how long it is kept and how to ask to see, correct or delete it.
The text lives in `templates/core/_privacy_body.html` and is included twice by
`core/privacy.html` — once inside the signed-in shell, once on the signed-out
page — so it exists in one place.

It is linked from the landing footer and the signup form, and listed in
`sitemap.xml` and `llms.txt` through `seo.PUBLIC_PAGES`. "Last updated" is
`PrivacyView.POLICY_UPDATED`, a constant: a template printing today's date
would claim a review that never happened. `PRIVACY_EMAIL` in
`apps/core/branding.py` is the contact address, deliberately not the no-reply
sender.

> It is a plain-language baseline, not legal advice — have it reviewed before
> the school relies on it.

### One dashboard per role

"The dashboard" is a different question for each role, so there are four
screens rather than one with three quarters hidden:

| Role | Lands on | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform owner | `/platform/` | Every school as a card you open — see [the platform owner's screens](#the-platform-owners-screens). |
| School owner | `/school/` | Every campus they run, side by side. |
| Principal | `/branch/` | Their campus: enrolment, classes, what is unpriced. |
| Bursar | `/finance/` | What the term is worth, and how much of it is in. |

Each keeps its summary figures and one chart; the breakdowns live on
[Reports](#reports), which every dashboard links to.

`ROLE_HOME` in `apps/core/navigation.py` is the single source for that mapping.
Both the post-login redirect and the sidebar's "Dashboard" entry read it, so
the link in the shell and the page you land on after signing in cannot drift
apart — a test asserts they agree for every role. `next=` still wins when
present, so a deep link survives the login page.

Reaching another role's dashboard by typing its URL is not a leak — the scoped
managers narrow it either way — but it is a screen answering someone else's
question, so `RoleDashboardMixin` sends you to your own instead.

The effective role comes from `TenantContext.from_user`, not `user.role`, which
is what sends a Django superuser to the platform overview rather than to
whatever role happens to be stored on their row.

### Signup is the one place without a tenant

There is no tenant yet, so the scoped managers would return nothing and a
uniqueness check that cannot see existing rows is not a uniqueness check.
`SchoolSignupForm` therefore uses `all_objects` throughout, and creates the
school, the branch and the owner in one transaction — a signup that produced a
School with no owner would leave a tenant nobody can sign into and no screen
from which to fix it.

The owner is created with **no branch**: they see every campus, and pinning them
to the first one would narrow them the day they open a second. The username is
derived from the email (they never type one), with a numeric suffix on collision
rather than a rejected signup.

### Onboarding progress is derived

`views.setup_progress()` asks the data — are there classes, fee structures,
students, colleagues? — rather than reading a "setup complete" flag. A flag
would go stale the moment someone deleted their last class, and the school would
be told it had finished a step it had not.

### Signing in, Account settings and temporary passwords

**The split panel.** Sign in, sign up and the four password-reset stages all
sit in `registration/_auth_base.html`: a branded gradient panel on one side, the
form on the other. Sign-in keeps the visual panel on the left; sign-up reverses
it. That reversal *is* the swap — both pages give the same two halves the same
`view-transition-name`, so navigating between them makes the browser move each
panel from where it was to where it now is. Below `lg` there is no split at all
and the form column takes over, so nothing depends on the two-column shape
existing.

**Email or username.** `apps/accounts/backends.py` signs people in with either.
The username is tried first, so every existing login keeps working. An email
matches case-insensitively, but only when exactly one account has it. Email is
not unique at the database level, and a login that picked one of two accounts
would sign someone in as a stranger. The username is derived from the email at
signup and does **not** follow a later email change. Matching on email is what
keeps a corrected address from stranding anyone's login.

**Account settings** (`/accounts/settings/`, "Account settings" in every role's
sidebar) is where anyone changes their own:

* **email address.** It asks for the current password, so an unattended session
  cannot point the account's reset emails elsewhere. An address another account
  already uses is refused.
* **password.** Django's `PasswordChangeForm`, so the new password goes through
  `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`, the same NIST-aligned policy signup and the reset
  flow use. Django's own `/accounts/password_change/` redirects here. The
  admin's password page is separate and unchanged.

**Temporary passwords.** `User.must_change_password` marks an account that was
given a password it did not choose. `RequirePasswordChangeMiddleware` sends
every request from such an account, the admin included, to Account settings,
except:

* Account settings itself
* the password generator
* signing out
* the reset-by-email flow
* static files

The flag is cleared inside `User.set_password`, so choosing a password by any
route ends it: Account settings, the reset email, or the admin. A platform owner
can also tick it in the admin to force a change.

### Creating real accounts

A password is never a command-line argument, where it would sit in shell
history and process listings.

| For | Command | How the password is set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yourself, as platform owner | `create_platform_owner --email … --name "…"` | Typed at a hidden prompt, twice, and validated. |
| A platform owner whose real email you have | `create_platform_owner --email … --name "…" --email-link` | Random and never shown; they are emailed the reset link. |
| A school owner whose real email you have | `invite_school_owner --school <slug> --email … --name "…"` | Random and never shown; they are emailed the reset link. |
| Anyone whose real email you do not have yet | add `--temporary-password` (and `--username` for a neutral one) | You type a temporary password at the prompt. It must be changed at first sign-in, and they correct the email on Account settings. |

Platform owners are superusers with no school, and land on `/platform/`.
`invite_school_owner` only attaches to a school that exists and never creates
one, so a mistyped slug is an error, not a duplicate tenant. Emailed links use
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; in production that is `https://www.theschoolcord.com`, and
the mail itself goes out through Resend (see "How mail is sent"). The
dev settings print mail to the console. So either send from production, or pass
`--no-email` and have the person use "Forgot password" on the live sign-in page.

### Accounts in production

Cleaned up on 2026-09-14:

* **Demo accounts removed:** `platform.owner` and `fulfilled-academy.owner`,
  `.principal` and `.bursar`. Their shared password had been published in this
  README.
* **Fulfilled Academy's seed data deleted:** students, fee structures and
  components, the term, classes, subjects and payments.
* **Kept for real onboarding:** the school itself, its Main Campus branch, and
  its messaging identity (Sender ID "Fulfilled").

Do not run `bootstrap_tenant` or any `seed_*` command against production.

### Trying it locally

```bash
python manage.py bootstrap_tenant --password "<a local password>"
```

Then sign in as `demo-school.owner`, `.principal`, `.bursar` or `platform.owner`
with that password, by username or by the `@example.com` address each one is
given. In dev the console backend prints password-reset emails, link included.

## Branding and identity

### One name, one file

`apps/core/branding.py` holds `PRODUCT_NAME` and nothing else does. Settings
imports it for `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `config/urls.py` for the admin header, and
a context processor puts it on every page — including the signed-out ones,
which is why it is a separate processor from `core.context_processors.tenancy`:
that one returns early for anonymous visitors, and the landing page and login
form are exactly where the product's name matters most.

The password-reset **email** is the one surface a context processor cannot
reach. Django renders it from the form, with a plain context and no request, so
`{{ product_name }}` there would silently render as nothing and ship "Reset
your  password" to a customer. `BrandedPasswordResetView` hands it in through
`extra_email_context`, and a test asserts the subject has no double space in it.

### The comment bug this pass fixed

Django's `{# ... #}` is **single-line only**. A comment that wraps onto a second
line is not a comment at all — the lexer never recognises it, and the browser
prints the developer's prose to the user. Twelve templates had one; the login
page was telling every visitor what Django does with a bad password.

Nothing fails when this happens: the template is valid, the page renders, the
tests pass. So there are two guards, and they work differently on purpose:

* `TemplateCommentSyntaxTests` reads every template's **source** and fails with
  the file and line number of any `{#` whose `#}` is on another line;
* `RenderedPageTests` reads the **rendered HTML** of every public page and
  fails on any `{#`, `#}`, `{%`, old brand name, `TODO` or lorem ipsum.

Multi-line comments belong in `{% comment %}...{% endcomment %}`, which is what
all twelve became.

### Logos

Two different marks, never interchangeable: **SCHOOLCORD's**, which says whose
software this is, and **the school's**, which says whose school you are looking
at.

| Partial | What it draws |
| --- | --- |
| `partials/_brand_mark.html` | SCHOOLCORD's official logo, from `static/img/`. |
| `partials/_school_logo.html` | A tenant's uploaded logo, or its initial square. |

#### The product mark

`static/img/schoolcord-logo.svg` is the primary asset, with
`schoolcord-logo.png` as the fallback. Two points with one cord between them —
the school and the parent on the same line — drawn in the brand tokens
(`#EEF3FB` ground; `#0F2A52` / `#1B4680` / `#2E63B0` marks), so it sits inside
the palette rather than beside it. A test asserts those four hex values are
still in the file, so a logo swapped in later cannot quietly drift off-palette.

It appears on the landing page, login, signup, password reset, onboarding, the
platform dashboard, the sidebar of every signed-in screen, the favicon and the
password-reset email.

Served from `static/` rather than inlined: it is a real asset with a filename
now, so one file gets replaced when the mark is revised, and browsers cache one
request instead of re-parsing the same markup on every page. It carries its own
light ground, so unlike the placeholder it replaced it needs no dark/light
variant — it reads on the brand-900 sidebar and the auth panel's gradient
alike.

Format per surface, because the constraint differs:

| Surface | Format | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screens | SVG, `onerror` → PNG | Crisp at any size; the fallback covers a blocked or missing SVG. |
| Favicon | SVG, `alternate icon` → PNG | Every current browser prefers SVG and stays sharp at 16px. |
| iOS home screen | PNG (`apple-touch-icon`) | Schools pin the dashboard on phones. |
| Email | PNG only, absolute URL | Mail clients do not render SVG, and have no site to be relative to. |

#### The school's mark

`School.logo` is an optional upload; without one, a school renders as its
initial in a coloured square — the same pattern the roster already uses for
students. That fallback is the answer, not a placeholder: most schools will
never upload a logo, and an initial square looks deliberate where a broken
image does not.

A school's own logo appears in its sidebar, on the platform roll, and on
printed payment receipts — where the print stylesheet forces
`print-color-adjust` so the fallback square is not dropped as a background
colour.

### How mail is sent

Production sends through **Resend**, over HTTPS, via `django-anymail`. It used
to use Django's SMTP backend, which did not fail so much as *hang*: the host
blocks outbound port 587, so a password reset held a web worker until the
request timed out and read to the user as a broken site.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` | `anymail.backends.resend.EmailBackend` (production) |
| `ANYMAIL["RESEND_API_KEY"]` | From `RESEND_API_KEY` in the environment. |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | `SCHOOLCORD <noreply@send.theschoolcord.com>` |

The From: address must be on **`send.theschoolcord.com`** — the subdomain
verified in Resend. The root domain is not verified, and Resend refuses to send
from an unverified sender, so `@theschoolcord.com` would fail every reset. The
address lives with the rest of the product's identity, in
`apps/core/branding.py`.

There are deliberately no `EMAIL_HOST`/`EMAIL_PORT`/`EMAIL_HOST_USER`/
`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` settings any more: Django reads those only for the SMTP
backend, so keeping them would be live-looking configuration that nothing uses.
Any left on the host are ignored. Dev still prints mail to the console.

`apps/core/tests_email.py` asserts all of it, including a password reset
arriving at Resend's API with the network stubbed and `smtplib` rigged to fail
the test if anything reaches for a socket.

### The password-reset email

Now multipart. The plain-text body Django has always sent is unchanged and
still stands on its own; alongside it goes an HTML half with the logo in the
header, written like email rather than like the rest of the app — tables for
layout, every style inline, palette as literal hex, because mail clients strip
`<style>` blocks and Outlook does not do flexbox.

Clients that block remote images fall back to the `alt`, which is why it reads
`SCHOOLCORD` and not "logo".

It is a `FileField` with an image validator rather than an `ImageField`, which
would pull in Pillow to read a header. The receipt upload on `payments.Payment`
made the same trade.

Upload it at **Settings** (`/settings/`), which is also what the sidebar's
Settings entry has been pointing at since the shell was built. The onboarding
page prompts for it from the school card at the top.

The school profile is deliberately **not** an onboarding checklist step: signup
already sets the name, and a logo is optional, so any "done" test would either
tick itself the moment the account existed or could never be ticked at all.

### The admin

Lightly skinned in `templates/admin/base_site.html` — brand blue through
Django's own theme variables, the product name from `site_header`, and the
house 8px corner. Not a rebuild: it is an internal tool, and the hex values are
literal because the admin does not load `app.css`.

### Demo data is obviously demo

The seed files are demo data carrying the pilot school's name, not a record of
the school: nobody in `roster.py` is a real person. That covers the roster,
`pricing.py`, `curriculum.py` and `seed_payments`. They exist so the screens have
something realistic to show locally, and production no longer holds any of it
(see [Accounts in production](#accounts-in-production)). What changed in this
pass is everything that was *filler* dressed as real:

* `bootstrap_tenant` now creates **"Demo School"**, not "Northgate Academy".
* The signup form's example is "Bright Future Academy", not the pilot school's
  actual name.
* Student and parent form placeholders are role words ("Surname", "Parent or
  guardian name") rather than invented people.
* **Every demo parent phone number moved to a sequential `0800` block.** They
  were valid eleven-digit numbers on live Nigerian mobile prefixes — point
  messaging at a real gateway with the seed loaded and fee reminders go to
  strangers. `0800` is a Nigerian toll-free service range, not a handset range:
  it satisfies the phone validator, reads as obviously invented, and cannot be
  delivered to. A test asserts every one of them starts `0800`.

Parent emails were already on `example.com`, which is reserved for this.

## Search engines and AI assistants

What crawlers see is driven by the tables in `apps/core/seo.py`, so the page
`<head>`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `llms.txt` cannot drift apart.

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/robots.txt` | Allows the public pages; disallows the admin, every signed-in area, `/media/` and each school's `/<slug>/enquiry/` page. Googlebot, Bingbot, Google-Extended, OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot and friends are named, with the same rules as `*`. |
| `/sitemap.xml` | The public pages, from Django's sitemap framework. |
| `/llms.txt` | A short Markdown summary of the product and links to its public pages. |

* **Public pages** are `PUBLIC_PAGES`: the home page, signup and sign-in. Each
  has its own `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph and Twitter tags. The
  home page also carries schema.org JSON-LD for the Organization and the
  SoftwareApplication. Other pages fall back to `PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION`.
* **A new app** needs its URL prefix in `PRIVATE_PATHS`, or its page in
  `PUBLIC_PAGES`. `apps/core/tests_seo.py` walks the URLconf and fails on a
  route that is in neither list.
* **Absolute URLs** (canonical, `og:image`, the sitemap) use `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`,
  so the Railway domain points search engines at `https://www.theschoolcord.com`
  instead of competing with it. Left blank, they fall back to the request.

## Navigation

`nav_for(role)` in `apps/core/navigation.py` is the server-side equivalent of a
client `navFor(role)`. A context processor injects the result, and
`templates/partials/_nav.html` renders it for both the desktop sidebar and the
mobile drawer. Links the role may not use are never emitted; destinations that
don't exist yet render greyed out with a "soon" tag and light up on their own
once the URL name exists.

Three gates, and an entry has to pass all three: the **role**, the **capability**
it declares (if any), and the **module** it belongs to (if any) — see
[Modules](#modules-what-each-school-has). Both sets default to empty, so a caller
that does not pass them gets the role-only menu with every gated entry hidden. That
is the safe direction: a menu offering too little is a bug somebody reports, and one
offering too much is a door the middleware then has to slam.

## Design tokens

All declared in `assets/app.css` under `@theme` (Tailwind v4), so each token
is both a utility and a CSS custom property.

- **Brand** — deep blue, `brand-50` … `brand-950` (`brand-900` = `#0f2547`).
- **Payment status** — `paid` (green), `partial` (amber), `unpaid` (slate),
  `overdue` (red), each with `-soft` and `-strong` variants. Use the
  `status-pill status-paid` pattern: colour is always paired with a label, never
  the only signal.
- **Icon accents** — `acc-blue`, `acc-indigo`, `acc-violet`, `acc-teal`,
  `acc-emerald`, `acc-amber`, `acc-rose`, each with a `-soft` tile tint. The one
  place colour is allowed to be loud, and only on an icon's tile
  (`class="icon-tile accent-violet"`) — never on body text or a control. Every
  pair is contrast-checked in both themes by `npm run check:contrast`.
- **Type** — Public Sans for UI, IBM Plex Mono for money and IDs (`.numeric`
  adds tabular figures).
- **Radii** — soft geometry: 14px is the house corner (`rounded-md`), 18px for
  cards (`rounded-lg`), up to 32px (`rounded-2xl`). `.squircle` upgrades to a
  real superellipse where `corner-shape` is supported and stays a generous
  rounded rectangle everywhere else.
- **Glass** — `--glass-bg`, `--glass-border`, `--glass-edge`, `--glass-blur`,
  plus a `--glass-dark-*` set for panes on the navy gradient. Used through
  `.glass` / `.glass-dark` / `.glass-lit`, and deliberately sparingly: a sticky
  bar, a hero card, a modal — never behind body copy.
- **Motion** — two curves (`--ease-out`, `--ease-spring`) and three durations,
  so every transition is one of a handful of recognisable movements.
- **Touch targets** — 44px minimum via `--spacing-touch` (`min-h-touch`,
  `size-touch`), applied to every button, input and nav link.

Components (`.btn`, `.card`, `.field-input`, `.nav-link`, `.status-pill`,
`.icon-tile`, `.bento-item`, `.chart-stack`) compose in markup —
`class="btn btn-primary"` — because Tailwind v4's `@apply` only accepts real
utilities.

### Charts are CSS, not a library

The dashboards draw collection, outstanding balances and the payment-status
split with `.chart-stack`, `.chart-bar-*` and `.chart-columns` — a width written
as a custom property, nothing loaded, nothing to keep working. They follow the
theme for the same reason a status pill does: the colours are tokens.

The four payment-status colours are a **status** palette, not a categorical one,
and they are never re-pointed to mean something else. Checked with a palette
validator, the amber/green pair separates by only ΔE 6.4 under protanopia in
light mode — inside the floor band, which is legal only with secondary encoding.
So every chart that uses them carries a labelled legend with counts and a 2px
gap between segments: identity never rests on hue alone.
`apps/core/templatetags/charts.py` does the proportion arithmetic and nothing
else — no template is allowed to total a column.

### Toasts

Every action in the app reports itself the same way: a small circle rises from
the bottom of the screen, opens sideways into a pill carrying an icon and a
sentence, holds, closes back into the circle and drops away.

**Views do not know toasts exist.** They call ordinary
`messages.success(...)` / `.error(...)` / `.warning(...)` / `.info(...)` and
`partials/_toasts.html` turns whatever is on the request into toasts. That is
the whole integration: the write paths across academics, fees, students, staff,
payments and admissions were already flashing messages before this existed and
lit up without being touched.

Four categories, and the colours are not new ones — three reuse the
payment-status soft/strong pairs that `npm run check:contrast` already checks
in both themes, and the fourth is glass:

| Level | Colour | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | green | the action completed |
| `error` | red | it failed, or was refused |
| `warning` | amber | it needs attention first |
| `info` | glass | neither good nor bad news |

Mechanics worth knowing:

- The movement is two interpolable properties: `transform`/`opacity` for the
  rise and drop, and a grid track going `0fr → 1fr` for the open and close —
  `width: auto` cannot be animated, a grid track can. It also means a long
  message wraps to two lines instead of being clipped.
- **The markup ships open.** `js/ui.js` closes each server-rendered toast and
  replays the entrance, so a blocked script costs the animation and never the
  message — the same bargain `.reveal` makes.
- The region lives at the end of `<body>` in `base.html`, *outside* the
  signed-in branch. Before this, `messages` rendered only inside the shell, so
  anything flashed on the way to a signed-out screen — a failed sign-in, a
  sign-out — was consumed by the template engine and shown to nobody.
- Colour is never the only signal: every toast has an icon and a
  visually-hidden category word ("Success: …"), inside a polite live region.
- Errors and warnings hold longer and carry a dismiss button; success and
  info simply go. Hovering or focusing a toast restarts its clock rather than
  freezing it, so one can never be parked on screen forever.
- At most four are visible; older ones retire early rather than stacking off
  the top of the screen.

Anything on a page can raise one with `window.toast(message, level)` (or
`toast.success(...)`). Markup can too: `data-toast-on-click="…"` plus
`data-toast-on-click-level="…"`, which is how the sidebar's not-yet-built rows
explain themselves instead of silently doing nothing.

A rejected form is announced without any view being involved: `.field-error`
only exists on a form that has been submitted and refused, so `js/ui.js` counts
them and raises one amber toast — "2 fields need attention. Nothing was saved."

A redirect nobody asked for says why it happened.
`RequirePasswordChangeMiddleware` flashes a warning as it sends an account on a
temporary password to Account settings, because otherwise pressing "Students"
and arriving at Account settings is a mystery. The persistent notice on that
page stays: it is something the user must act on, and a toast that disappears
is the wrong carrier for that.

`admissions/public_base.html` — the school-branded enquiry shell, which
deliberately does not extend `base.html` — includes the region too. Nothing
flashes a message on that flow today; the point is that adding one later
reaches the parent reading the page instead of being swallowed.

### Authorisation is answered, not re-asked

`handler403` is `apps.core.views.permission_denied`. It leaves the refusal
exactly as it was — the view never ran, the status is still **403**, and every
test asserting that a bursar cannot reach an academic-setup URL still asserts
that — and adds the reason as an error toast, so a refusal arrives where every
other answer in the app arrives.

What it deliberately does not do is ask for credentials. A signed-in principal
who lacks a capability is already who they are; a password prompt would answer
a question nobody asked. `templates/403.html` carries no password field and no
link to the sign-in page, and a test asserts both — the page is the brand
gradient with a glass panel on it, a plain sentence ("Your role doesn't have
access to this"), the specific reason underneath, and one button back to
`core:dashboard`, which forwards each role to its own home.

The signed-out half of that template *does* offer a sign-in link, because
there the thing standing between the reader and the page really is
authentication.

That prompt had a real source, now fixed: the owner dashboard and the fee
structure list linked "Manage branches", "Set a term" and "Add a term" to the
**Django admin**, and a proprietor's account is deliberately not `is_staff` —
so those links answered a click with the admin's username-and-password form on
a site they were already signed in to. They point at the real tenant-scoped
screens (`schools:branch_list`, `fees:term_list`, `fees:term_create`) instead.
The only remaining `/admin/` link is on the platform overview, whose role *is*
a superuser.

### Dark mode is a second design, not a filter

The ramps invert for dark mode: `brand-50` is the palest blue in light mode and
a deep navy in dark, `ink-900` is near-black then near-white. That is what lets
`text-ink-900` mean "primary text" in both themes without a single `dark:`
variant in a template — and it is a trap on any surface that does **not**
invert.

The navy plane is exactly that surface. The sidebar, the hero, the problem
cards, the closing CTA, the auth visual panel and the 403 band are navy in
*both* themes, so a brand-ramp colour on them moves while the ground stays
still. `text-brand-100` on the hero measured **1.01:1** in dark mode —
invisible, not merely dim.

Four tokens exist for that plane and nothing else should be used there:

| Token | For |
| --- | --- |
| `panel-fg` | headings, white |
| `panel-copy` | body copy |
| `panel-muted` | secondary text, figures |
| `panel-subtle` | small uppercase labels |

All four are checked against the panel in both themes by
`npm run check:contrast`, so the regression cannot come back quietly.

The hero photograph's dim is a token too (`--hero-photo-dim`): the dark-mode
gradient beneath it is darker, so the same multiplier composites the classroom
down to nearly nothing. It is lifted in dark rather than shared.

### Page transitions and reduced motion

Navigation between screens is a cross-document view transition declared in CSS
(`@view-transition { navigation: auto }`), so there is no router and nothing to
go wrong where it is unsupported. `templates/base.html` names the sidebar
`vt-sidebar` and the content column `vt-page`, which is what makes the shell
stay put while the page inside it changes. The auth split panel names its two
halves on **both** the sign-in and the sign-up page, so the browser animates the
panel physically crossing the screen; `js/ui.js` applies a CSS-animation
fallback only where view transitions are missing, never both.

`prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured globally in `@layer base`, restated for
view-transition pseudo-elements (which `*` cannot reach), and checked in JS
before any observer is armed. Nothing is hidden and no state becomes
unreachable — motion is removed, content is not.

### Scrollbars, and a prefix that was doing harm

Scrollbars are themed from `--scrollbar-thumb` / `--scrollbar-track` — both
`scrollbar-color` (the standard property) and the `::-webkit-scrollbar`
pseudo-elements, driven by the same tokens. The navy panes take
`.scroll-on-panel` instead, for the same reason their text takes panel tokens.
12px, not 6px: shrinking a scrollbar because it looks tidier is a real cost to
anyone who drags one.

One thing worth knowing if you add another frosted surface: **write
`backdrop-filter` only, never the `-webkit-` alias.** Lightning CSS prefixes
from its own browser targets, and seeing both spellings made it treat the
unprefixed declaration as redundant and drop it — leaving ten of fourteen glass
rules `-webkit-` only, which is the one spelling Firefox does not support. The
blur was silently missing there.

### The low-end device tier

`js/ui.js` sets `<html data-perf="lite">` when the device reports few cores,
little memory, or Data Saver. The stylesheet's `[data-perf="lite"]` block then
turns off every `backdrop-filter`, the hero's blur and the card drift in one
place, rather than each component guessing. Everything still renders — glass
becomes a solid tint — so "lite" costs texture, never content or legibility.

## Layout

`templates/base.html` is the shell every role dashboard extends: a
**collapsible** sidebar from `lg` up, off-canvas drawer below it, sticky
header, skip link, dependency-free JS.

Collapsing is one attribute — `<html data-sidebar="collapsed">` — which drives
both the rail's width and the content column's padding through
`--sidebar-w`. They have to move together or the page tears down the middle,
and one variable is what guarantees it. The choice is stored in localStorage
and re-applied by the inline script in `<head>`, the same no-flash trick the
theme uses, so a collapsed rail is already collapsed in the first frame.

The rail's scroll position is remembered in sessionStorage per navigation. A
long menu scrolled to Payments used to jump back to the top on every click,
which on a rail this tall means hunting for your place every time. It is
written on scroll rather than on `beforeunload`, which is unreliable on mobile
and blocks the back-forward cache.

**Which row is highlighted** is the *most specific* match, not every match.
`_resolve` marks an item active when the path starts with its href — right for
`/students/41/` lighting up Students, wrong when one entry's href is a prefix
of another's. Four pairs here are (`/fees/` and `/fees/terms/`, `/payments/`
and `/payments/outstanding/`, …), so opening Terms lit Fee Structures too and
read exactly like a row that had failed to clear. Signed-out pages fill `{% block anonymous_content %}` and
skip the shell entirely.

```
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block page_title %}Fees{% endblock %}
{% block content %}...{% endblock %}
```

## Admin

Schools, branches and users are editable at `/admin/` immediately.
`TenantScopedAdminMixin` narrows both the changelists and the foreign-key
dropdowns, so a school owner cannot see — or reassign a row to — another tenant.
Django superusers bypass it.
