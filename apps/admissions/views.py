"""Admissions screens: the public front door, and the school's daily tool.

Two audiences, and the split is the whole shape of this module.

**The public page** is unauthenticated and scoped by the school's slug. It is
the second place on the platform -- after signup -- that runs with no tenant
context, so every queryset it touches is spelled ``all_objects`` and narrowed
by hand to the school in the URL. That narrowing is the security boundary:
nothing the browser sends decides which school a submission lands in.

**The staff screens** are the opposite. Not one of them filters by school or
branch, because ``Applicant.objects`` is a tenant-scoped manager and has
already done it -- a principal's pipeline is their own campus, another school's
applicant 404s rather than leaking, and no view here has to remember why.

What the staff screens do carry is the *stage* logic: which button a person
sees on an applicant depends on where that applicant stands, and every
transition is guarded server-side as well, so a stale tab cannot decide
somebody twice.
