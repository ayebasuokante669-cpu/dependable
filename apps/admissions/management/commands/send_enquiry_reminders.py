"""Email parents whose enquiry is running down, prompting them to continue.

    python manage.py send_enquiry_reminders
    python manage.py send_enquiry_reminders --dry-run

Meant for a nightly cron, alongside ``expire_enquiries``. Run this one first:
reminding somebody the morning their enquiry lapses is better than reminding
them the morning after.

The cut-off is per school -- one school holds an enquiry for three weeks and
nudges at day seven, another has its own numbers -- so this cannot be a single
``filter()``. The command walks the schools that have live enquiries and
applies each one's own :class:`~apps.admissions.models.AdmissionsConfig`.

``reminder_sent_at`` is stamped by the notifier and only on success, so a
message that failed to send is retried by tomorrow's run rather than being
silently marked done. One reminder per enquiry, ever: a second and third
identical email is how a school's mail starts being marked as spam.

Runs unscoped -- there is no signed-in user in a cron job.
