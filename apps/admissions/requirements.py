"""What an applicant must supply, by level -- and where that answer comes from.

The client's rule is not one list: a passport photograph is asked of every
applicant, an entrance examination is asked of Primary and Secondary but never
of Nursery, and the supporting documents differ again between a four-year-old
starting Pre-KG and a fifteen-year-old transferring into SSS 2.

So the requirement set is *data*, not a chain of ``if level ==`` in a form.
Three layers answer "what does this applicant owe us?", narrowest first:

1. a branch's own :class:`~apps.admissions.models.RequirementSet` for that level,
2. the school's set for that level (``branch`` null -- one policy, every campus),
3. the defaults below.

A school that has configured nothing still gets a sensible, complete answer,
and a school that disagrees with one line changes that line rather than being
told the platform knows better. :func:`profile_for` is the only function any
caller needs; nothing outside this module should be reading the table.

The defaults are ordinary day-school practice rather than a guess dressed as
one: a child entering Nursery has no previous school to produce results from,
and a child entering JSS 1 from another school carries a transfer letter
because their old school issues one on the way out.
