"""Staff admissions URLs, mounted at ``/admissions/``.

The public enquiry page is deliberately *not* here -- it lives at the root
under the school's slug, so a school can hand a parent
``schoolcord.app/fulfilled-academy/enquiry`` rather than a path with the
platform's own vocabulary in it. See :mod:`apps.admissions.public_urls`.
