"""Admissions: one prospective child, captured once, moved along until enrolled.

The paid add-on beyond the original scope. Its shape is set by one decision
worth stating up front, because everything else follows from it:

**An applicant is its own entity, not a Student with a draft flag.**
A ``Student`` is a child on the roll -- billed, counted in the head count,
present in every report the school runs. A child whose parent filled a form on
Instagram at midnight is none of those things, and the moment the two share a
table every ``Student.objects`` query in the platform starts returning people
who have never set foot in the school. Enrolment is therefore a *conversion*:
:mod:`apps.admissions.enrolment` creates the Student, and the applicant keeps
its history and a link to who it became.

Second decision: **one record, many stages.** An enquiry does not become a
different row when it becomes an application. The status advances and the
application stage *adds* fields to what was already captured, which is the
whole reason a parent is never asked for their child's date of birth twice.

    enquiry -> application -> assessed -> offered/rejected -> enrolled
                                                           \\-> expired
                                                           \\-> withdrawn

Third: **admission money is not term money.** ``fees.FeeStructure`` is what a
class owes per term and is not touched here. What a family pays to come in --
the one-time admission fee, the intake items, the compulsory book list -- is
:class:`AdmissionFeeSchedule` and :class:`AdmissionFeeItem`, a separate set
with its own payments, so seeding or repricing one can never overwrite the
other.

Everything is tenant-scoped by inheritance, so no view in this app filters by
school or branch: one school cannot see another's applicants because the
managers already made that impossible.
