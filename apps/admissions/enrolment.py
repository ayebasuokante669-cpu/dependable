"""The conversion: an accepted applicant becomes a student on the roll.

This is the one moment the admissions pipeline touches the rest of the
platform, and the only place in the app that writes to another app's table. It
is deliberately a service function rather than a model method, because it is a
*transaction across two apps* -- a Student is created, an Applicant is closed,
and either both happen or neither does. A half-run conversion would leave a
child enrolled with nobody able to find the application they were admitted on.

What the conversion is not: it does not copy fees, does not create a payment,
and does not touch the termly fee structure. The new student is billed by the
same rule as every other student -- their class's structure for the current
term -- from the moment they exist. What the family paid to come in stays on
the applicant as :class:`~apps.admissions.models.AdmissionPayment` rows, which
is what keeps intake money out of a term's collection figure.

The applicant is kept, not deleted. ``applicant.student`` is the link, and the
history -- who enquired, when, from which Instagram post, what they scored --
survives the conversion. Losing it would make the intake unanswerable a term
later.
