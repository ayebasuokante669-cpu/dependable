    # -- deletion ----------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Deleting a school is closing a tenant, and the four PROTECT foreign keys
    # in this codebase made that impossible from here: Django's delete view met
    # the first one, listed the protected rows, and offered no button. The way
    # through was to empty the payments by hand, then the students, then the
    # classes, one changelist at a time.
    #
    # So the question is asked once and the whole school goes. The PROTECTs stay
    # exactly as they are on the models, where they guard the everyday case of
    # somebody tidying one class; apps/schools/teardown.py explains why that is
    # the right place for them and this is the right place for the exception.

        The stock implementation walks the graph and puts every PROTECTed row in
        ``protected``, which is what makes the template hide the confirm button.
        Nothing is protected *from this operation* -- the teardown removes those
        rows deliberately, in the order the database asks for -- so ``protected``
        comes back empty and the page can be confirmed.

        ``perms_needed`` is still computed the way Django computes it. A staff
        account that may not delete payments must not acquire that power by
        going through a school, and dropping the check to simplify this would
