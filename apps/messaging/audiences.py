"""Turning "JSS 1A parents" into a list of phone numbers.

One module, because the same resolution has to answer three different questions
and they must never disagree:

* the live count on the compose screen, before anything is sent;
* the rows actually written when Send is pressed;
* the description stored on the message, which is what the log will say
  happened.

All three come out of :func:`resolve`, so the count a bursar saw is by
construction the batch that went out.

Every queryset here goes through ``Student.objects``, which is tenant-scoped.
That is what stops one branch messaging another's parents -- not a filter in a
view, which someone would eventually forget to write.
