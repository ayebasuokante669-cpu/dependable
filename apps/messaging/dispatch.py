"""Sending: the one path from a resolved audience to rows in the delivery log.

Two steps, deliberately separate:

``record`` writes the ``Message`` and one ``MessageRecipient`` per parent, all
pending, inside a transaction. Nothing has been sent at this point, and that is
the safe state to be interrupted in -- a crashed request leaves a batch that is
visibly queued, not a batch that may or may not have gone out.

``deliver`` walks those rows and hands each to the provider. It never raises
for a delivery failure: one wrong number must not stop the other thirty-one
parents from hearing about their fees. Failures land on the row, the batch
status rolls up, and the bursar sees exactly which two of thirty-two bounced.

Doing the sending inline rather than on a queue is a considered pilot decision:
a branch's whole parent body is a few hundred rows, the console provider has no
latency to speak of, and a task queue is a piece of infrastructure the school
would have to run. When a real gateway makes the loop slow, ``deliver`` is what
moves onto a worker -- it already takes a saved batch and touches nothing else.

Every batch is sent under one school's own Sender ID, resolved once by
:mod:`apps.messaging.identity` before anything is written. Resolving it first
is what makes "a school with no approved Sender ID sends nothing" true rather
than aspirational: there is no path from here to a provider that does not go
through that resolution, and a school that fails it never gets a Message row at
all -- so the log never shows a batch that was never really sendable.
