"""Fulfilled Academy's First Term 2025/2026 fee schedule.

The single source for seeding, the same way ``academics/curriculum.py`` is for
classes and subjects: edit the tuples below and re-run
``manage.py seed_fees --replace``.

Two things to know about how this data is expressed:

* A spec listing several class names creates *one structure per class*, not one
  shared row. "Primary 2-6" charge the same today, but each class owns its own
  components so any one of them can be repriced without touching the others.
* ``client_total`` is a cross-check, never stored. Where the school's written
  total disagrees with the line items, the seeder charges the line items and
  prints a warning. Inventing a balancing component to make the arithmetic work
  would bury a real question about the source data.
