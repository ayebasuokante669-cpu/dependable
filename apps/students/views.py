"""Student management screens.

As with academics and fees, no view here filters by school or branch:
``Student.objects`` is a tenant-scoped manager, so the list is already narrowed
and another branch's student 404s rather than leaking.

What is new at this layer is the fee position shown against each student. It is
never read off the student -- :mod:`apps.students.fees` derives it from the
class's fee structure for the current term, in a fixed number of queries per
page.

The Excel import is three screens rather than one: download the template,
upload and see the verdict, then confirm. The middle screen writes nothing, and
the parsed rows wait in the session between it and the confirmation, where they
are validated a *second* time against the live database -- the roster can have
changed while the report was on screen, and the report the user agreed to has to
be the one that gets written.
