"""The fix/bugs3 batch, and the invariants each fix now rests on.

Five of the seven are bugs with a shared shape -- something was configured or
wired in a way that failed quietly -- so most of what is here is the assertion that
would have caught it:

* **step 4 sent a proprietor to the Django admin login.** The third time this class
  of bug has appeared (Branches, Staff and Terms were the first), so it is tested
  the way ``tests_role_access`` tests those: follow the link a person would click
  and assert on what comes back;
* **a school could invite another owner**, which would have handed over the only
  role that can invite and the only one that can switch an account off;
* **the platform's Dashboard and Schools shared a URL**, so both sidebar rows lit;
* **uploads went to the container's disk**, which nothing serves in production and
  which does not survive a restart -- the cause of both the 404s and of the logo
  that "worked on the school side";
* **the welcome email failed silently**, because best effort was implemented as
  best effort with no way to find out.

The date picker is the one feature rather than a fix, and what is testable about it
is that it reaches the fields it is for and leaves the real input alone.
