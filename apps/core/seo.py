"""What search engines and AI assistants are told about SCHOOLCORD.

Four surfaces describe the public site to machines -- the ``<head>`` of each
public page, ``robots.txt``, ``sitemap.xml`` and ``llms.txt`` -- and each of
them used to be the kind of file that drifts: a page added to the sitemap but
not to robots, a description rewritten on the page but not in the JSON-LD. So
all four read from the tables in this module:

* :data:`PUBLIC_PAGES` is the whole public site. Its titles and descriptions go
  into the ``<head>``, its URLs into the sitemap and ``llms.txt``, and robots
  explicitly allows each of them.
* :data:`PRIVATE_PATHS` is everything behind a login, plus each school's own
  pages. ``tests_seo`` walks the URLconf and fails if a route is in neither
  list, so a new app cannot become crawlable by being forgotten.
* :data:`FEATURES` is what the product does, shared by the structured data and
  ``llms.txt``.

Absolute URLs are built from ``PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` (``https://www.theschoolcord.com``
in production) rather than from the request, so the Railway-generated domain
that also serves the app points search engines at the real address instead of
competing with it.
