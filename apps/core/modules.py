"""Which features a school has, as distinct from what its staff may do with them.

Three questions now decide whether an account can reach a screen, and they are
deliberately separate:

* **Tenancy** (``apps.core.tenancy``) -- *which rows?*
* **Capabilities** (``apps.core.permissions``) -- *which actions?*
* **Modules** (this file) -- *which features does this school have at all?*

A module is a commercial fact about a school, not a permission. Admissions is a
paid add-on; parent messaging costs the platform money per message. A school that
has not taken them should not see them, and its principal should not be able to
reach them by typing a URL -- but nothing about that is a statement about the
principal, which is why it cannot live in the capability table.

**The registry below is the only place a module is declared.** Adding one means
adding an entry here: its URL prefixes, the capabilities it owns, its default, and
whether it can be switched off at all. Nothing else in the codebase should grow a
list of module names.

**Nothing is deleted when a module is switched off.** The rows stay, the code stays,
the URLs stay routed; the module is simply not available to that school, and
switching it back on the same afternoon restores every screen exactly as it was.
That is the whole point of a toggle rather than an uninstall.

**Enforcement is in three places, each because it knows something the others do
not.**

1. :class:`apps.core.middleware.ModuleAccessMiddleware` gates the URL prefixes for
   the caller's own school. It is a middleware rather than a mixin so a view added
   later is covered without anybody remembering to cover it.
2. :func:`apps.core.permissions.capabilities_of` withdraws the module's
   capabilities, which closes the buttons and links that other apps' screens draw
   -- the fee-reminder button on the bursar's dashboard is a messaging action
   sitting on a payments page.
3. :func:`apps.core.navigation.nav_for` drops the module's nav entries, so the
   sidebar never offers a door that the middleware would shut.

The one route none of those can gate is the school's *public* enquiry page, at
``/<school-slug>/enquiry/``. It belongs to the school named in the URL rather than
to the caller -- there usually is no caller -- so it checks for itself, in
``apps.admissions.views.PublicEnquiryView``.
