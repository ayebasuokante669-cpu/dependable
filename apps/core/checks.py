"""Deploy-time warnings for the things that fail silently at runtime.

Every check here exists because something was configured wrong and nothing said
so. The welcome email is the worked example: it is best-effort by design -- a
failed send must not turn a completed signup into an error page -- so a missing
``PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` or an absent Resend key produced a log line nobody was reading
and a school that never heard from us. "Best effort" has to mean the *request*
survives, not that the misconfiguration stays hidden.

``manage.py check --deploy`` runs these, and so does every ``manage.py`` command,
so a bad deploy says so on the way up rather than on the first signup.

Warnings rather than errors throughout: none of these stops the app serving pages,
and a check that refused to boot over an unsendable email would be a worse failure
than the one it is reporting.
