"""The product's own name and mark, in one place.

The platform has been called three things during development -- an internal
codename, a working title, and now SCHOOLCORD -- and the last rename left the
old names scattered across page titles, the sidebar, password-reset email and
the admin header. One constant, read by settings, the admin and every template
through a context processor, is what stops that happening a fourth time.

This is the *product's* identity. A tenant school's own name and logo are on
:class:`apps.schools.models.School`, and the two are never interchangeable: a
parent reading a receipt wants their school's name on it, and a proprietor
signing in wants to know whose software they are signing in to.

PRODUCT_NAME = "SCHOOLCORD"

#: One line, used on the landing page and in the footer.

#: The general way in: the footer, the About page, and anywhere a school is
#: invited to get in touch. A real mailbox a person reads, unlike the no-reply
#: sender below -- and deliberately separate from PRIVACY_EMAIL, which is a
#: statutory contact point named in the policy and should not collect sales

#: The product's own accounts, in the order the footer draws them.
#:
#: One list, read by the footer and by the About page, so an account added here
#: appears in both and neither can carry a link the other does not. ``icon`` names
#: a glyph in templates/partials/_social_icon.html.
#:
#: The URLs are the share links as supplied, query strings and all -- ``?s=11`` on
#: X and ``stkn=...&utm_source=qr`` on Instagram. Both are what those apps hand you
#: when you share a profile from a phone, and both are kept on purpose: the tail is
#: the platform's own attribution, and stripping it would quietly drop whatever it
#: reports back.
#:
#: The ``&`` in the Instagram URL is left as a literal ampersand here. Django
#: escapes it to ``&amp;`` on the way into the ``href``, which is correct HTML and
#: resolves to the same address -- so anything asserting on the rendered page has
#: to escape it too, and the tests do.
