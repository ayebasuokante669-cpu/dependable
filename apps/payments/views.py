"""Payment screens: record, the pending queue, history, outstanding, receipt.

No view here filters by school or branch -- ``Payment.objects`` is tenant-scoped
like every other feature model, so a list is already narrowed and another
branch's payment 404s.

Nothing on these screens stores a balance. Every figure is derived through
:mod:`apps.payments.balances`, which is why confirming a pending receipt or
voiding a payment moves the student's balance, the outstanding list, the bursar's
dashboard and messaging's "parents who owe" in the same instant, with no
recalculation step anywhere.
