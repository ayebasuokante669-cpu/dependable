"""Recording, confirming and voiding money.

The student picker is a text input backed by a native ``<datalist>`` rather
than a long ``<select>`` or a JavaScript autocomplete. Three reasons, in order
of how much they matter:

* it is how the job is actually done -- the bursar has a receipt in front of
  them with an admission number on it, and types it;
* the browser's own search matches on the whole option, so typing a surname
  finds the child too;
* it needs no endpoint and no script, so it works on the front-desk machine
  with whatever is installed on it.

The typed value is resolved back to a ``Student`` through the tenant-scoped
manager, so a copied-and-pasted admission number from another school finds
nothing.
