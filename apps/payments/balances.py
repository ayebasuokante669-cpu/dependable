"""What a student has actually paid, and therefore what they still owe.

Everything here is derived. Nothing is stored, nothing is cached on a student,
and no screen is allowed to add up its own version:

    expected  = the class's FeeStructure total for the term  (apps.fees)
    paid      = the sum of that student's CONFIRMED payments for the term
    balance   = expected - paid
    status    = paid / partial / unpaid, or overdue past the term's due date

:func:`paid_by_student` is the seam ``apps.students.fees`` reaches for through
the app registry. Because it is the single definition of "paid", a pending
receipt cannot leak into a balance from one screen and not another, and voiding
a payment moves every figure on the platform at once.
