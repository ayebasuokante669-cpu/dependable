"""Account screens: Account settings, and the password generator behind Generate.

Generation lives on the server so there is exactly one implementation of the
policy. A JavaScript generator would be a second definition of "strong enough"
that no Django test could reach, and the two would drift the first time the
policy changed. Here the button and the form agree because they call the same
:func:`~apps.accounts.passwords.generate_password`, which in turn calls the same
validators the form does.

The endpoint has to be reachable signed-out -- signup is where it is needed
most -- so it is throttled. It is cheap in itself, but in production each call
runs the policy, and the policy includes a request to Have I Been Pwned; an
open, unthrottled endpoint would let anyone use this deployment to generate
traffic against theirs.
