"""Building the collections report: what it covers, and what it says.

Two jobs live here.

**Scope.** :func:`resolve_scope` answers "which campuses is this report about?".
The tenant-scoped managers have already decided which campuses the caller is
*allowed* to see; scope narrows that further to the one school or campus they
asked for. A principal has one campus and no choice to make; a proprietor picks
between theirs; the platform owner picks a school first. Nothing here widens
anything -- every queryset still goes through ``objects``, so a filter can only
ever produce a subset of what the caller could already read.

**The figures.** :func:`build` produces the :class:`~apps.reports.structure.Report`
that the page and the PDF both render. It defines nothing of its own:

* what a student is expected to pay, and which of the four states that puts them
  in, comes from ``apps.students.fees``;
* what counts as money received comes from ``apps.payments``, through
  ``apps.core.finance``, which the four dashboards read as well;
* who still owes comes from ``apps.payments.balances.outstanding`` -- the same
  call the bursar's chase list and messaging's "parents who owe" resolve to.

All this module does is *group* those answers -- by school, by campus, by class,
by method, by month -- and format them.

Two figures on this report are deliberately not the same thing, and it says so
in its own notes rather than quietly picking one:

* **Collected**, everywhere money is totalled, is every confirmed payment
  credited to the term. That is the till question, it is what the bursar's
  dashboard shows, and it adds up: the campus rows sum to the headline.
* **Still owed**, on the outstanding list, is what the *current roster* has left
  to pay. That is the chase question. It parts company with
  expected-less-collected whenever a student who has paid has since left, or a
  parent has overpaid.
